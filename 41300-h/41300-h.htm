<h2><a name="THE_FIRST_SETTLEMENT_OF_NEW_ENGLAND" id="THE_FIRST_SETTLEMENT_OF_NEW_ENGLAND"></a>THE FIRST SETTLEMENT OF NEW ENGLAND</h2>

<p class="center">A DISCOURSE DELIVERED AT PLYMOUTH,
MASSACHUSETTS, DEC. 22, 1820.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[In 1820 the &ldquo;Pilgrim Society&rdquo; was formed by the citizens of
Plymouth, Massachusetts, and the descendants of the Pilgrims in other
places, desirous of uniting &ldquo;to commemorate the landing, and to honor
the memory of the intrepid men who first set foot on Plymouth Rock.&rdquo;
The foundation of this society gave a new impulse to the anniversary
celebrations of the two hundredth anniversary of the landing of the
Pilgrims at Plymouth. Mr. Webster was requested to deliver the
public address on the 22d of December of that year, and the following
discourse was pronounced by him, in the presence of a great gathering
of people.]</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Beginning
of the third
century of
New England
history.</div>

<p>Let us rejoice that we behold this day. Let us be
thankful that we have lived to see the bright and happy
breaking of the auspicious morn which commences
the third century of the history of
New England. Auspicious, indeed,&mdash;bringing
a happiness beyond the common allotment
of Providence to men,&mdash;full of present joy, and gilding
with bright beams the prospect of futurity, is the dawn
that awakens us to the commemoration of the landing of
the Pilgrims.</p>

<p>Living at an epoch which naturally marks the progress
of the history of our native land, we have come hither<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
to celebrate the great event with which that history
commenced. Forever honored be this, the place of our
fathers&rsquo; refuge! Forever remembered the day which
saw them, weary and distressed, broken in everything
but spirit, poor in all but faith and courage, at last
secure from the dangers of wintry seas, and impressing
this shore with the first footsteps of civilized man!</p>

<div class="sidenote">New
England&rsquo;s
ancestors.</div>

<p>It is a noble faculty of our nature which enables us
to connect our thoughts, our sympathies, and our happiness
with what is distant in place or time;
and, looking before and after, to hold communion
at once with our ancestors and our
posterity. Human and mortal although we are, we are
nevertheless not mere insulated beings, without relation
to the past or the future. Neither the point of time, nor
the spot of earth, in which we physically live, bounds
our rational and intellectual enjoyments. We live in the
past by a knowledge of its history; and in the future,
by hope and anticipation. By ascending to an association
with our ancestors, by contemplating their example
and studying their character, by partaking their
sentiments and imbibing their spirit, by accompanying
them in their toils, by sympathizing in their sufferings,
and rejoicing in their successes and their triumphs, we
seem to belong to their age and to mingle our own existence
with theirs. We become their contemporaries,
live the lives which they lived, endure what they endured,
and partake in the rewards which they enjoyed.
And in like manner, by running along the line of future
time, by contemplating the probable fortunes of those
who are coming after us, by attempting something which
may promote their happiness and leave some not dishonorable
memorial of ourselves for their regard when
we shall sleep with the fathers, we protract our own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
earthly being, and seem to crowd whatever is future, as
well as all that is past, into the narrow compass of our
earthly existence. As it is not a vain and false, but an
exalted and religious imagination which leads us to
raise our thoughts from the orb which, amidst this universe
of worlds, the Creator has given us to inhabit, and
to send them with something of the feeling which nature
prompts, and teaches to be proper among children of the
same Eternal Parent, to the contemplation of the myriads
of fellow-beings with which his goodness has peopled the
infinite of space; so neither is it false or vain to consider
ourselves as interested and connected with our
whole race, through all time; allied to our ancestors;
allied to our posterity; closely compacted on all sides
with others; ourselves being but links in the great chain
of being, which begins with the origin of our race, runs
onward through its successive generations, binding together
the past, the present, and the future, and terminating
at last, with the consummation of all things
earthly, at the throne of God.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Pilgrim
Fathers.</div>

<p>We have come to this Rock, to record here our homage
for our Pilgrim Fathers;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> our sympathy in their sufferings;
our gratitude for their labors; our
admiration of their virtues; our veneration
for their piety; and our attachment to those principles
of civil and religious liberty which they encountered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>the dangers of the ocean, the storms of heaven, the
violence of savages, disease, exile, and famine, to enjoy
and to establish. And we would leave here, also, for
the generations which are rising up rapidly to fill our
places, some proof that we have endeavored to transmit
the great inheritance unimpaired; that in our estimate
of public principles and private virtue, in our veneration
of religion and piety, in our devotion to civil
and religious liberty, in our regard for whatever advances
human knowledge or improves human happiness,
we are not altogether unworthy of our origin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The genius
of the place.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Plymouth
Rock.</div>

<p>There is a local feeling connected with this occasion,
too strong to be resisted; a sort of genius of the place,
which inspires and awes us. We feel that
we are on the spot where the first scene of
our history was laid; where the hearths and altars of
New England were first placed; where Christianity and
civilization and letters made their first lodgment, in a
vast extent of country, covered with a wilderness, and
peopled by roving barbarians. We are here at the season
of the year at which the event took place. The imagination
irresistibly and rapidly draws around us the
principal features and the leading characters in the
original scene. We cast our eyes abroad on the ocean,
and we see where the little bark, with the interesting
group upon its deck, made its slow progress to the
shore. We look around us, and behold the hills and
promontories where the anxious eyes of our fathers first
saw the places of habitation and of rest. We feel the
cold which benumbed, and listen to the winds which
pierced them. Beneath us is the Rock on
which New England received the feet of the
Pilgrims. We seem even to behold them as they struggle
with the elements, and with toilsome efforts gain the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
shore. We listen to the chiefs in council; we see the
unexampled exhibition of female fortitude and resignation;
we hear the whisperings of youthful impatience;
and we see what a painter of our own has also represented
by his pencil,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> chilled and shivering childhood,
houseless but for a mother&rsquo;s arms, couchless but for a

joy for dangers escaped; their deep solicitude about
dangers to come; their trust in Heaven; their high
religious faith, full of confidence and anticipation,&mdash;all
of these seem to belong to this place, and to be present
upon this occasion, to fill us with reverence and
admiration.</p>

of the landing

<p>The settlement of New England by the colony which
landed here on the twenty-second<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of December, 1620,
although not the first European establishment
in what now constitutes the United States, was
yet so peculiar in its causes and character,
and has been followed and must still be followed
by such consequences, as to give it a
high claim to lasting commemoration. On these causes
and consequences, more than on its immediately attendant
circumstances, its importance as an historical event
depends. Great actions and striking occurrences, having
excited a temporary admiration, often pass away<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
and are forgotten, because they leave no lasting results
affecting the prosperity and happiness of communities.
Such is frequently the fortune of the most brilliant
military achievements. Of the ten thousand battles
which have been fought, of all the fields fertilized with
carnage, of the banners which have been bathed in blood,
of the warriors who have hoped that they had risen from
the field of conquest to a glory as bright and as durable
as the stars, how few that continue long to interest mankind!
The victory of yesterday is reversed by the defeat
of to-day; the star of military glory, rising like a
meteor, like a meteor has fallen; disgrace and disaster
hang on the heels of conquest and renown; victor and
vanquished presently pass away to oblivion, and the
world goes on in its course, with the loss only of so
many lives and so much treasure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Battle
of Marathon.</div>

<p>But if this be frequently, or generally, the fortune of
military achievements, it is not always so. There are
enterprises, military as well as civil, which sometimes
check the current of events, give a new turn to human
affairs, and transmit their consequences through ages.
We see their importance in their results, and call them
great, because great things follow. There have been
battles which have fixed the fate of nations. These
come down to us in history with a solid and permanent
interest, not created by a display of glittering armor,
the rush of adverse battalions, the sinking and rising of
pennons, the flight, the pursuit, and the victory; but
by their effect in advancing or retarding human knowledge,
in overthrowing or establishing despotism, in extending
or destroying human happiness. When the
traveller pauses on the plain of Marathon,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> what are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>the emotions which most strongly agitate his breast?
What is that glorious recollection which thrills through
his frame, and suffuses his eyes? Not, I
imagine, that Grecian skill and Grecian valor
were here most signally displayed; but that Greece herself
was saved. It is because to this spot, and to the
event which has rendered it immortal, he refers all the
succeeding glories of the republic. It is because, if
that day had gone otherwise, Greece had perished. It
is because he perceives that her philosophers and orators,
her poets and painters, her sculptors and architects,
her governments and free institutions, point
backward to Marathon, and that their future existence
seems to have been suspended on the contingency
whether the Persian or the Grecian banner should wave
victorious in the beams of that day&rsquo;s setting sun. And,
as his imagination kindles at the retrospect, he is transported
back to the interesting moment; he counts the
fearful odds of the contending hosts; his interest for
the result overwhelms him; he trembles, as if it were
still uncertain, and seems to doubt whether he may consider
Socrates and Plato, Demosthenes, Sophocles, and
Phidias, as secure yet to himself and to the world.</p>

shall last for ages; we shall plant here a new
society, in the principles of the fullest liberty
and the purest religion; we shall subdue this wilderness
which is before us; we shall fill this region of
the great continent, which stretches almost from pole to
pole, with civilization and Christianity; the temples of
the true God shall rise where now ascends the smoke
of idolatrous sacrifice; fields and gardens, the flowers
of summer, and the waving and golden harvest of
autumn, shall spread over a thousand hills and stretch
along a thousand valleys, never yet, since the creation,
reclaimed to the use of civilized man. We shall whiten
this coast with the canvas of a prosperous commerce;
we shall stud the long and winding shore with a hundred
cities. That which we sow in weakness shall be
raised in strength. From our sincere but houseless
worship there shall spring splendid temples to record
God&rsquo;s goodness; from the simplicity of our social union
there shall arise wise and politic constitutions of government,
full of the liberty which we ourselves bring
and breathe; from our zeal for learning, institutions
shall spring which shall scatter the light of knowledge
throughout the land, and in time, paying back where
they have borrowed, shall contribute their part to the
great aggregate of human knowledge; and our descendants,
through all generations, shall look back to this spot
and to this hour with unabated affection and regard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Love of religious
liberty
the motive
for the settlement
of New
England.</div>

<p>Of the motives which influenced the first settlers to a
voluntary exile, induced them to relinquish their native
country, and to seek an asylum in this then unexplored<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
wilderness, the first and principal, no doubt, were connected
with religion. They sought to enjoy a higher
degree of religious freedom, and what they
esteemed a purer form of religious worship,
than was allowed to their choice, or presented
to their imitation, in the Old World. The love
of religious liberty is a stronger sentiment,
when fully excited, than an attachment to civil or
political freedom. That freedom which the conscience
demands, and which men feel bound by their hope of
salvation to contend for, can hardly fail to be attained.
Conscience, in the cause of religion and the worship of
the Deity, prepares the mind to act and to suffer beyond
almost all other causes. It sometimes gives an impulse
so irresistible that no fetters of power or of opinion can
withstand it. History instructs us that this love of
religious liberty, a compound sentiment in the breast
of man, made up of the clearest sense of right and the
highest conviction of duty, is able to look the sternest
despotism in the face, and, with means apparently most
inadequate, to shake principalities and powers. There
is a boldness, a spirit of daring, in religious reformers,
not to be measured by the general rules which control
men&rsquo;s purposes and actions. If the hand of power be laid
upon it, this only seems to augment its force and its elasticity,
and to cause its action to be more formidable and
violent. Human invention has devised nothing, human
power has compassed nothing, that can forcibly restrain
it when it breaks forth. Nothing can stop it, but to
give way to it; nothing can check it, but indulgence.
It loses its power only when it has gained its object.
The principle of toleration, to which the world has
come so slowly, is at once the most just and the most
wise of all principles. Even when religious feeling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
takes a character of extravagance and enthusiasm, and
seems to threaten the order of society and shake the
columns of the social edifice, its principal danger is in
its restraint. If it be allowed indulgence and expansion,
like the elemental fires, it only agitates, and perhaps
purifies, the atmosphere; while its efforts to throw
off restraint would burst the world asunder.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religious persecutions
in
England.</div>

<p>It is certain, that, although many of them were republicans
in principle, we have no evidence that our New
England ancestors would have emigrated, as
they did, from their own native country, would
have become wanderers in Europe, and finally
would have undertaken the establishment of a colony
here, merely from their dislike of the political systems of
Europe. They fled not so much from the civil government
as from the hierarchy, and the laws which enforced
conformity to the church establishment. Mr.
Robinson<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> had left England as early as 1608, on account
of the persecutions for non-conformity, and had retired
to Holland. He left England from no disappointed ambition
in affairs of state, from no regrets at the want of
preferment in the church, nor from any motive of distinction
or of gain. Uniformity in matters of religion
was pressed with such extreme rigor that a voluntary
exile seemed the most eligible mode of escaping from
the penalties of non-compliance. The accession of Elizabeth
had, it is true, quenched the fires of Smithfield,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
and put an end to the easy acquisition of the crown of
martyrdom. Her long reign had established the Reformation,
but toleration was a virtue beyond her conception
and beyond the age. She left no example of it to
her successor; and he was not of a character which
rendered it probable that a sentiment either so wise or
so liberal would originate with him. At the present
period it seems incredible that the learned, accomplished,
unassuming, and inoffensive Robinson should neither be
tolerated in his peaceable mode of worship in his own
country, nor suffered quietly to depart from it. Yet
such was the fact. He left his country by stealth, that
he might elsewhere enjoy those rights which ought to
belong to men in all countries. The departure of the
Pilgrims for Holland is deeply interesting, from its
circumstances, and also as it marks the character of the
times, independently of its connection with names now
incorporated with the history of empire. The embarkation
was intended to be made in such a manner that it
might escape the notice of the officers of government.
Great pains had been taken to secure boats which should
come undiscovered to the shore and receive the fugitives;
and frequent disappointments had been experienced
in this respect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The embarkation
from
Lincolnshire.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The stormy
voyage to
Holland.</div>

<p>At length the appointed time came, bringing with it
unusual severity of cold and rain. An unfrequented
and barren heath, on the shores of Lincolnshire,
was the selected spot where the feet
of the Pilgrims were to tread for the last
time the land of their fathers. The vessel which was
to receive them did not come until the next day, and
in the mean time the little band was collected, and men
and women and children and baggage were crowded
together, in melancholy and distressed confusion. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>sea was rough, and the women and children were already
sick, from their passage down the river to the place of
embarkation on the sea. At length the wished-for boat
silently and fearfully approaches the shore, and men
and women and children, shaking with fear and with
cold, as many as the small vessel could bear, venture
off on a dangerous sea. Immediately the advance of
horses is heard from behind, armed men appear, and
those not yet embarked are seized and taken into custody.
In the hurry of the moment, the first parties had
been sent on board without any attempt to keep members
of the same family together; and on account of the
appearance of the horsemen, the boat never returned
for the residue. Those who had got away, and those
who had not, were in equal distress. A storm, of great
violence and long duration, arose at sea,
which not only protracted the voyage, rendered
distressing by the want of all those accommodations
which the interruption of the embarkation
had occasioned, but also forced the vessel out of her
course, and menaced immediate shipwreck; while those
on shore, when they were dismissed from the custody
of the officers of justice, having no longer homes or
houses to retire to, and their friends and protectors
being already gone, became objects of necessary charity
as well as of deep commiseration.</p>

</div>

<p>As this scene passes before us, we can hardly forbear
asking whether this be a band of malefactors and felons
flying from justice. What are their crimes, that they
hide themselves in darkness? To what punishment
are they exposed, that, to avoid it, men and women
and children thus encounter the surf of the North Sea
and the terrors of a night storm? What induces this
armed pursuit and this arrest of fugitives, of all ages
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
and both sexes? Truth does not allow us to answer
these inquiries in a manner that does credit to the
wisdom or the justice of the times. This was not the
flight of guilt, but of virtue. It was an humble and
peaceable religion, flying from causeless oppression. It
was conscience, attempting to escape from the arbitrary
rule of the Stuarts. It was Robinson and Brewster,
leading off their little band from their native soil, at
first to find shelter on the shore of the neighboring
continent, but ultimately to come hither; and having
surmounted all difficulties and braved a thousand
dangers, to find here a place of refuge and of rest.
Thanks be to God, that this spot was honored as the
asylum of religious liberty! May its standard, reared
here, remain forever! May it rise up as high as
heaven, till its banner shall fan the air of both continents,
and wave as a glorious ensign of peace and security to
the nations!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Pilgrims
sought a
home, not a
place of exile.</div>

<p>They came hither to a land from which they were never
to return. Hither they had brought, and here they were
to fix, their hopes, their attachments, and their
objects in life. Some natural tears they shed,
as they left the pleasant abodes of their fathers,
and some emotions they suppressed, when the white
cliffs of their native country, now seen for the last time,
grew dim to their sight. They were acting, however,
upon a resolution not to be daunted. With whatever
stifled regrets, with whatever occasional hesitation, with
whatever appalling apprehensions, which might sometimes
arise with force to shake the firmest purpose, they
had yet committed themselves to Heaven and the elements;
and a thousand leagues of water soon interposed
to separate them forever from the region which gave
them birth. A new existence awaited them here; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
when, they saw these shores, rough, cold, barbarous,
and barren, as then they were, they beheld their country.
That mixed and strong feeling which we call love of
country, and which is, in general, never extinguished in
the heart of man, grasped and embraced its proper
object here. Whatever constitutes country, except the
earth and the sun, all the moral causes of affection and
attachment which operate upon the heart, they had
brought with them to their new abode. Here were
now their families and friends, their homes and their
property. Before they reached the shore, they had
established the elements of a social system, and at a
much earlier period had settled their forms of religious
worship. At the moment of their landing, therefore,
they possessed institutions of government and institutions
of religion; and friends and families, and social
and religious institutions, framed by consent, founded
on choice and preference, how nearly do these fill up
our whole idea of country! The morning that beamed
on the first night of their repose saw the Pilgrims already
at home in their country. There were political institutions,
and civil liberty, and religious worship. Poetry
has fancied nothing, in the wanderings of heroes, so
distinct and characteristic. Here was man, indeed, unprotected,
and unprovided for, on the shore of a rude
and fearful wilderness; but it was politic, intelligent,
and educated man. Everything was civilized but the
physical world. Institutions, containing in substance
all that ages had done for human government, were
organized in a forest. Cultivated mind was to act on
uncultivated nature; and, more than all, a government
and a country were to commence, with the very first
foundations laid under the divine light of the Christian
religion. Happy auspices of a happy futurity! Who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
would wish that his country&rsquo;s existence had otherwise
begun? Who would desire the power of going back
to the ages of fable? Who would wish for an origin
obscured in the darkness of antiquity? Who would
wish for other emblazoning of his country&rsquo;s heraldry, or
other ornaments of her genealogy, than to be able to
say, that her first existence was with intelligence, her
first breath the inspiration of liberty, her first principle
the truth of divine religion?</p>

<p>Local attachments and sympathies would erelong
spring up in the breasts of our ancestors, endearing to
them the place of their refuge. Whatever natural
objects are associated with interesting scenes and high
efforts obtain a hold on human feeling, and demand
from the heart a sort of recognition and regard. This
Rock soon became hallowed in the esteem of the Pilgrims,
and these hills grateful to their sight. Neither
they nor their children were again to till the soil of
England, nor again to traverse the seas which surround
her. But here was a new sea, now open to their enterprise,
and a new soil, which had not failed to respond
gratefully to their laborious industry, and which was
already assuming a robe of verdure. Hardly had they
provided shelter for the living, ere they were summoned
to erect sepulchres for the dead. The ground had
become sacred, by enclosing the remains of some of
their companions and connections. A parent, a child,
a husband, or a wife had gone the way of all flesh, and
mingled with the dust of New England. We naturally
look with strong emotions to the spot, though it be a
wilderness, where the ashes of those we have loved repose.
Where the heart has laid down what it loved most, there
it is desirous of laying itself down. No sculptured marble,
no enduring monument, no honorable inscription,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
no ever-burning taper that would drive away the darkness
of the tomb, can soften our sense of the reality
of death, and hallow to our feelings the ground which
is to cover us, like the consciousness that we shall sleep,
dust to dust, with the objects of our affections.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their chosen
land.</div>

<p>In a short time other causes sprung up to bind the
Pilgrims with new cords to their chosen land. Children
were born, and the hopes of future generations
arose, in the spot of their new habitation. The
second generation found this the land of their nativity,
and saw that they were bound to its fortunes. They
beheld their fathers&rsquo; graves around them, and while they
read the memorials of their toils and labors, they rejoiced
in the inheritance which they found bequeathed to
them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Popular
government
in America.</div>

<p>The nature and constitution of society and government
in this country are interesting topics, to which
I would devote what remains of the time
allowed to this occasion. Of our system of
government the first thing to be said is, that
it is really and practically a free system. It originates
entirely with the people, and rests on no other foundation
than their assent. To judge of its actual operation,
it is not enough to look merely at the form of its construction.
The practical character of government depends
often on a variety of considerations, besides the
abstract frame of its constitutional organization. Among
these are the condition and tenure of property; the laws
regulating its alienation and descent; the presence or
absence of a military power; an armed or unarmed
yeomanry; the spirit of the age, and the degree of
general intelligence. In these respects it cannot be
denied that the circumstances of this country are most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
favorable to the hope of maintaining the government of
a great nation on principles entirely popular. In the
absence of military power, the nature of government
must essentially depend on the manner in which property
is holden and distributed. There is a natural influence
belonging to property, whether it exists in many hands
or few; and it is on the rights of property that both
despotism and unrestrained popular violence ordinarily
commence their attacks. Our ancestors began their
system of government here under a condition of comparative
equality in regard to wealth, and their early
laws were of a nature to favor and continue this
equality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The distribution
of
property in
New England.</div>

<p>A republican form of government rests not more on
political constitutions than on those laws which regulate
the descent and transmission of property. Governments
like ours could not have been
maintained where property was holden according to
the principles of the feudal system; nor, on the
other hand, could the feudal constitution possibly exist
with us. Our New England ancestors brought hither no
great capitals from Europe; and if they had, there was
nothing productive in which they could have been invested.
They left behind them the whole feudal policy of
the other continent. They broke away at once from the
system of military service established in the Dark Ages,
and which continues, down even to the present time,
more or less to affect the condition of property all over
Europe. They came to a new country. There were,
as yet, no lands yielding rent, and no tenants rendering
service. The whole soil was unreclaimed from barbarism.
They were themselves, either from their original
condition or from the necessity of their common interest,
nearly on a general level in respect to property. Their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
situation demanded a parcelling out and division of
the lands, and it may be fairly said, that this necessary
act fixed the future frame and form of their government.
The character of their political institutions
was determined by the fundamental laws respecting
property.</p>

<p>The laws rendered estates divisible among sons and
daughters. The right of primogeniture, at first limited
and curtailed, was afterwards abolished. The property
was all freehold. The entailment of estates, long trusts,
and the other processes for fettering and tying up inheritances,
were not applicable to the condition of society,
and seldom made use of. On the contrary, alienation
of the land was every way facilitated, even to the subjecting
of it to every species of debt. The establishment
of public registries, and the simplicity of our
forms of conveyance, have greatly facilitated the change
of real estate from one proprietor to another. The consequence
of all these causes has been a great subdivision
of the soil, and a great equality of condition; the true
basis, most certainly, of a popular government. &ldquo;If
the people,&rdquo; says Harrington, &ldquo;hold three parts in four
of the territory, it is plain there can neither be any
single person nor nobility able to dispute the government
with them; in this case, therefore, except force be
interposed, they govern themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The American
system of
government.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Roman
commonwealth.</div>

<p>The division of governments into departments, and
the division, again, of the legislative department into
two chambers, are essential provisions in our
system. This last, although not new in itself,
yet seems to be new in its application to governments
wholly popular. The Grecian republics, it is
plain, knew nothing of it; and in Rome, the check and
balance of legislative power, such as it was, lay between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the people and the senate. Indeed, few things are more
difficult than to ascertain accurately the true nature and
construction of the Roman commonwealth.
The relative power of the senate and the
people, of the consuls and the tribunes,
appears not to have been at all times the same, nor
at any time accurately defined or strictly observed.
Cicero, indeed, describes to us an admirable arrangement
of political power, and a balance of the constitution,
in that beautiful passage in which he compares
the democracies of Greece with the Roman commonwealth.</p>

<p>But at what time this wise system existed in this
perfection at Rome, no proofs remain to show. Her
constitution, originally framed for a monarchy, never
seemed to be adjusted in its several parts after the expulsion
of the kings. Liberty there was, but it was a disputatious,
an uncertain, an ill-secured liberty. The
patrician and plebeian orders, instead of being matched
and joined, each in its just place and proportion, to
sustain the fabric of the state, were rather like hostile
powers, in perpetual conflict. With us, an attempt has
been made, and so far not without success, to divide
representation into chambers, and, by difference of age,
character, qualification, or mode of election, to establish
salutary checks, in governments altogether elective.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Education
in New
England.</div>

<p>Having detained you so long with these observations,
I must yet advert to another most interesting topic,&mdash;the
Free Schools. In this particular New
England may be allowed to claim, I think,
a merit of a peculiar character. She early
adopted, and has constantly maintained, the principle
that it is the undoubted right and the bounden duty of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
government to provide for the instruction of all youth.
That which is elsewhere left to chance or to charity, we
secure by law. For the purpose of public instruction,
we hold every man subject to taxation in proportion to
his property, and we look not to the question, whether
he himself have, or have not, children to be benefited by
the education for which he pays. We regard it as a
wise and liberal system of police, by which property,
and life, and the peace of society are secured. We seek
to prevent in some measure the extension of the penal
code, by inspiring a salutary and conservative principle
of virtue and of knowledge in an early age. We strive
to excite a feeling of respectability, and a sense of character,
by enlarging the capacity and increasing the
sphere of intellectual enjoyment. By general instruction,
we seek, as far as possible, to purify the whole
moral atmosphere; to keep good sentiments uppermost,
and to turn the strong current of feeling and opinion, as
well as the censures of the law and the denunciations of
religion, against immorality and crime. We hope for a
security beyond the law, and above the law, in the prevalence
of an enlightened and well-principled moral sentiment.
We hope to continue and prolong the time
when, in the villages and farm-houses of New England,
there may be undisturbed sleep within unbarred doors.
And knowing that our government rests directly on the
public will, in order that we may preserve it we endeavor
to give a safe and proper direction to that public will.
We do not, indeed, expect all men to be philosophers or
statesmen; but we confidently trust, and our expectation
of the duration of our system of government rests on
that trust, that, by the diffusion of general knowledge
and good and virtuous sentiments, the political fabric
may be secure, as well against open violence and over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>throw
as against the slow, but sure, undermining of
licentiousness.</p>

<p>A conviction of the importance of public instruction
was one of the earliest sentiments of our ancestors. No
lawgiver of ancient or modern times has expressed more
just opinions, or adopted wiser measures, than the early
records of the Colony of Plymouth show to have prevailed
here. Assembled on this very spot, a hundred
and fifty-three years ago, the legislature of this Colony
declared, &ldquo;Forasmuch as the maintenance of good literature
doth much tend to the advancement of the weal and
flourishing state of societies and republics, this Court
doth therefore order, that in whatever township in this
government, consisting of fifty families or upwards, any
meet man shall be obtained to teach a grammar school,
such township shall allow at least twelve pounds, to be
raised by rate on all the inhabitants.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Harvard
College.</div>

<p>Having provided that all youth should be instructed
in the elements of learning by the institution of free
schools, our ancestors had yet another duty
to perform. Men were to be educated for
the professions and the public. For this purpose
they founded the university, and with incredible zeal
and perseverance they cherished and supported it,
through all trials and discouragements. On the subject
of the university, it is not possible for a son of New
England to think without pleasure, or to speak without
emotion. Nothing confers more honor on the state
where it is established, or more utility on the country
at large. A respectable university is an establishment
which must be the work of time. If pecuniary means
were not wanting, no new institution could possess
character and respectability at once. We owe deep
obligation to our ancestors, who began, almost on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
moment of their arrival, the work of building up this
institution.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/illus035.jpg" width="640" height="264" alt="A View of Harvard College." title="" />
<span class="caption"><i>A View of Harvard College.</i></span>
</div>

<p>Although established in a different government, the
Colony of Plymouth manifested warm friendship for
Harvard College. At an early period, its government
took measures to promote a general subscription throughout
all the towns in this Colony, in aid of its small
funds. Other colleges were subsequently founded and
endowed, in other places, as the ability of the people
allowed; and we may flatter ourselves that the means
of education at present enjoyed in New England are not
only adequate to the diffusion of the elements of knowledge
among all classes, but sufficient also for respectable
attainments in literature and the sciences.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religious
influences.</div>

<p>Lastly, our ancestors established their system of
government on morality and religious sentiment. Moral
habits, they believed, cannot safely be trusted
on any other foundation than religious principle,
nor any government be secure which is not supported
by moral habits. Living under the heavenly
light of revelation, they hoped to find all the social<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
dispositions, all the duties which men owe to each other
and to society, enforced and performed. Whatever
makes men good Christians, makes them good citizens.
Our fathers came here to enjoy their religion free and
unmolested; and, at the end of two centuries, there is
nothing upon which we can pronounce more confidently,
nothing of which we can express a more deep and
earnest conviction, than of the inestimable importance
of that religion to man, both in regard to this life and
that which is to come.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duty of
the descendants
of the Pilgrims.</div>

<p>If the blessings of our political and social condition
have not been too highly estimated, we cannot well
overrate the responsibility and duty which
they impose upon us. We hold these institutions
of government, religion, and learning
to be transmitted as well as enjoyed. We are in the
lines of conveyance, through which whatever has been
obtained by the spirit and efforts of our ancestors is to
be communicated to our children.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">American
constitutional
history.</div>

<p>We are bound not only to maintain the general
principles of public liberty, but to support also those
existing forms of government which have so
well secured its enjoyment, and so highly
promoted the public prosperity. It is now
more than thirty years that these States have been
united under the Federal Constitution, and whatever
fortune may await them hereafter, it is impossible that
this period of their history should not be regarded as
distinguished by signal prosperity and success. They
must be sanguine, indeed, who can hope for benefit from
change. Whatever division of the public judgment
may have existed in relation to particular measures of
the government, all must agree, one should think, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
opinion that in its general course it has been eminently
productive of public happiness. Its most ardent friends
could not well have hoped from it more than it has
accomplished; and those who disbelieved or doubted
ought to feel less concern about predictions which the
event has not verified than pleasure in the good which
has been obtained. Whoever shall hereafter write this
part of our history, although he may see occasional errors
or defects, will be able to record no great failure in the
ends and objects of government. Still less will he be
able to record any series of lawless and despotic acts,
or any successful usurpation. His page will contain
no exhibition of provinces depopulated, of civil authority
habitually trampled down by military power, or of a
community crushed by the burden of taxation. He will
speak, rather, of public liberty protected, and public
happiness advanced; of increased revenue, and population
augmented beyond all example; of the growth of
commerce, manufactures, and the arts; and of that
happy condition in which the restraint and coercion of
government are almost invisible and imperceptible, and
its influence felt only in the benefits which it confers.
We can entertain no better wish for our country than
that this government may be preserved; nor have a
clearer duty than to maintain and support it in the full
exercise of all its just constitutional powers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">American
literature.</div>

<p>The cause of science and literature also imposes upon
us an important and delicate trust. The wealth and
population of the country are now so far
advanced as to authorize the expectation of
a correct literature and a well-formed taste, as well as
respectable progress in the abstruse sciences. The
country has risen from a state of colonial subjection;
it has established an independent government, and is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
now in the undisturbed enjoyment of peace and political
security. The elements of knowledge are universally
diffused, and the reading portion of the community is
large. Let us hope that the present may be an auspicious
era of literature. If, almost on the day of their landing,
our ancestors founded schools and endowed colleges,
what obligations do not rest upon us, living under circumstances
so much more favorable both for providing
and for using the means of education? Literature
becomes free institutions. It is the graceful ornament
of civil liberty, and a happy restraint on the asperities
which political controversies sometimes occasion. Just
taste is not only an embellishment of society, but it rises
almost to the rank of the virtues, and diffuses positive
good throughout the whole extent of its influence.
There is a connection between right feeling and right
principles, and truth in taste is allied with truth in
morality. With nothing in our past history to discourage
us, and with something in our present condition
and prospects to animate us, let us hope that, as it is
our fortune to live in an age when we may behold a
wonderful advancement of the country in all its other
great interests, we may see also equal progress and
success attend the cause of letters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The influence
of religion.</div>

<p>Finally, let us not forget the religious character of
our origin. Our fathers were brought hither by their
high veneration for the Christian religion.
They journeyed by its light, and labored in
its hope. They sought to incorporate its principles
with the elements of their society, and to diffuse its
influence through all their institutions, civil, political,
or literary. Let us cherish these sentiments, and extend
this influence still more widely, in the full conviction
that that is the happiest society which partakes in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the highest degree of the mild and peaceful spirit of
Christianity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The future
progress of
New England.</div>

<p>The hours of this day are rapidly flying, and this
occasion will soon be passed. Neither we nor our
children can expect to behold its return.
They are in the distant regions of futurity,
they exist only in the all-creating power of
God, who shall stand here a hundred years hence, to
trace, through us, their descent from the Pilgrims, and
to survey, as we have now surveyed, the progress of
their country during the lapse of a century. We would
anticipate their concurrence with us in our sentiments
of deep regard for our common ancestors. We would
anticipate and partake the pleasure with which they will
then recount the steps of New England&rsquo;s advancement.
On the morning of that day, although it will not disturb
us in our repose, the voice of acclamation and gratitude,
commencing on the Rock of Plymouth, shall be transmitted
through millions of the sons of the Pilgrims, till
it lose itself in the murmurs of the Pacific seas.</p>

<p>We would leave, for the consideration of those who
shall then occupy our places, some proof that we hold
the blessings transmitted from our fathers in just estimation;
some proof of our attachment to the cause of good
government, and of civil and religious liberty; some
proof of a sincere and ardent desire to promote everything
which may enlarge the understandings and improve
the hearts of men. And when, from the long distance
of a hundred years, they shall look back upon us, they
shall know, at least, that we possessed affections which,
running backward and warming with gratitude for what
our ancestors have done for our happiness, run forward
also to our posterity, and meet them with cordial salutation,
ere yet they have arrived on the shore of being.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>Advance, then, ye future generations! We would
hail you, as you rise in your long succession, to fill the
places which we now fill, and to taste the blessings of
existence where we are passing, and soon shall have
passed, our own human duration. We bid you welcome
to this pleasant land of the fathers. We bid you
welcome to the healthful skies and the verdant fields
of New England. We greet your accession to the great
inheritance which we have enjoyed. We welcome you
to the blessings of good government and religious liberty.
We welcome you to the treasures of science and the
delights of learning. We welcome you to the transcendent
sweets of domestic life, to the happiness of
kindred and parents and children. We welcome you
to the immeasurable blessings of rational existence, the
immortal hope of Christianity, and the light of everlasting
truth!</p>

<p>This uncounted multitude before me and around me
proves the feeling which the occasion has excited.
These thousands of human faces, glowing with sympathy

gratitude turned reverently to heaven in this spacious

of Bunker
Hill, June
17, 1775.</div>

<p>If, indeed, there be anything in local association fit
to affect the mind of man, we need not strive to repress
the emotions which agitate us here. We are among
the sepulchres of our fathers. We are on ground distinguished
by their valor, their constancy, and the
shedding of their blood. We are here, not to fix an
uncertain date in our annals, nor to draw into notice
an obscure and unknown spot. If our humble purpose
had never been conceived, if we ourselves had never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
been born, the 17th of June, 1775, would have been
a day on which all subsequent history would have
poured its light, and the eminence where we
stand a point of attraction to the eyes of successive
generations. But we are Americans.
We live in what may be called the early age of this
great continent; and we know that our posterity,
through all time, are here to enjoy and suffer the allotments
of humanity. We see before us a probable train
of great events; we know that our own fortunes have
been happily cast; and it is natural, therefore, that
we should be moved by the contemplation of occurrences
which have guided our destiny before many of
us were born, and settled the condition in which we
should pass that portion of our existence which God
allows to men on earth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
discovery
of America.</div>

<p>We do not read even of the discovery of this continent,
without feeling something of a personal interest
in the event; without being reminded how
much it has affected our own fortunes and
our own existence. It would be still more
unnatural for us, therefore, than for others, to contemplate
with unaffected minds that interesting, I may say
that most touching and pathetic scene, when the great
discoverer of America stood on the deck of his shattered
bark, the shades of night falling on the sea, yet no man
sleeping; tossed on the billows of an unknown ocean,
yet the stronger billows of alternate hope and despair
tossing his own troubled thoughts; extending forward
his harassed frame, straining westward his anxious and
eager eyes, till Heaven at last granted him a moment
of rapture and ecstasy, in blessing his vision with the
sight of the unknown world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The first
settlement
of New
England.</div>

<p>Nearer to our times, more closely connected with our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>fates, and therefore still more interesting to our feelings
and affections, is the settlement of our own country
by colonists from England. We cherish
every memorial of these worthy ancestors;
we celebrate their patience and fortitude;
we admire their daring enterprise; we teach our children
to venerate their piety; and we are justly proud
of being descended from men who have set the world
an example of founding civil institutions on the great
and united principles of human freedom and human
knowledge. To us, their children, the story of their
labors and sufferings can never be without its interest.
We shall not stand unmoved on the shore of Plymouth,
while the sea continues to wash it; nor will our brethren
in another early and ancient colony forget the place
of its first establishment, till their river shall cease to
flow by it.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> No vigor of youth, no maturity of manhood,
will lead the nation to forget the spots where its
infancy was cradled and defended.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
American
Revolution.</div>

<p>But the great event in the history of the continent,
which we are now met here to commemorate, that
prodigy of modern times, at once the wonder
and the blessing of the world, is the American
Revolution.  In a day of extraordinary
prosperity and happiness, of high national honor, distinction,
and power, we are brought together, in this
place, by our love of country, by our admiration of
exalted character, by our gratitude for signal services
and patriotic devotion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The object
of the
monument.</div>

<p>The Society whose organ I am was formed for the
purpose of rearing some honorable and durable monu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>ment
to the memory of the early friends of American
Independence. They have thought that for this object
no time could be more propitious than the
present prosperous and peaceful period, that
no place could claim preference over this
memorable spot, and that no day could be more auspicious
to the undertaking than the anniversary of the
battle which was here fought. The foundation of that
monument we have now laid. With solemnities suited
to the occasion, with prayers to Almighty God for his
blessing, and in the midst of this cloud of witnesses,
we have begun the work. We trust it will be prosecuted,
and that, springing from a broad foundation,
rising high in massive solidity and unadorned grandeur,
it may remain as long as Heaven permits the works
of man to last, a fit emblem, both of the events in
memory of which it is raised, and of the gratitude of
those who have reared it.</p>

<p>We know, indeed, that the record of illustrious
actions is most safely deposited in the universal remembrance
of mankind. We know that if we could cause
this structure to ascend, not only till it reached the
skies, but till it pierced them, its broad surfaces could
still contain but part of that which, in an age of knowledge,
hath already been spread over the earth, and
which history charges itself with making known to all
future times. We know that no inscription on entablatures
less broad than the earth itself can carry information
of the events we commemorate where it has not
already gone; and that no structure which shall not
outlive the duration of letters and knowledge among
men can prolong the memorial. But our object is,
by this edifice, to show our own deep sense of the value
and importance of the achievements of our ancestors;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
and, by presenting this work of gratitude to the eye, to
keep alive similar sentiments, and to foster a constant
regard for the principles of the Revolution. Human
beings are composed, not of reason only, but of imagination
also, and sentiment; and that is neither wasted
nor misapplied which is appropriated to the purpose
of giving right direction to sentiments, and opening
proper springs of feeling in the heart.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance
of the site.</div>

<p>Let it not be supposed that our object is to perpetuate
national hostility, or even to cherish a mere military
spirit. It is higher, purer, nobler. We consecrate our
work to the spirit of national independence, and we
wish that the light of peace may rest upon it forever.
We rear a memorial of our conviction of that unmeasured
benefit which has been conferred on our
own land, and of the happy influences which
have been produced, by the same events, on the general
interests of mankind. We come, as Americans, to mark
a spot which must forever be dear to us and our posterity.
We wish that whosoever, in all coming time,
shall turn his eye hither, may behold that the place
is not undistinguished where the first great battle of
the Revolution was fought. We wish that this structure
may proclaim the magnitude and importance of
that event to every class and every age. We wish that
infancy may learn the purpose of its erection from
maternal lips, and that weary and withered age may
behold it, and be solaced by the recollections which
it suggests. We wish that labor may look up here, and
be proud in the midst of its toil. We wish that, in
those days of disaster which, as they come upon all
nations, must be expected to come upon us also, desponding
patriotism may turn its eyes hitherward, and
be assured that the foundations of our national power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
are still strong. We wish that this column, rising
towards heaven among the pointed spires of so many
temples dedicated to God, may contribute also to produce,
in all minds, a pious feeling of dependence and
gratitude. We wish, finally, that the last object to the
sight of him who leaves his native shore, and the first
to gladden his who revisits it, may be something which
shall remind him of the liberty and the glory of his
country. Let it rise! let it rise, till it meet the sun in
his coming; let the earliest light of the morning gild it,
and parting day linger and play on its summit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The survivors
of
1775.</div>

<p>We still have among us some of those who were active
agents in the scenes of 1775, and who are now
here, from every quarter of New England, to
visit once more, and under circumstances so
affecting, I had almost said so overwhelming,
this renowned theatre of their courage and patriotism.</p>

<p>Venerable men! you have come down to us from a
former generation. Heaven has bounteously lengthened
out your lives, that you might behold this joyous day.
You are now where you stood fifty years ago, this very
hour, with your brothers and your neighbors, shoulder
to shoulder, in the strife for your country. Behold, how
altered! The same heavens are indeed over your heads;
the same ocean rolls at your feet; but all else how
changed! You hear now no roar of hostile cannon,
you see no mixed volumes of smoke and flame rising
from burning Charlestown. The ground strewed with
the dead and the dying; the impetuous charge; the
steady and successful repulse; the loud call to repeated
assault; the summoning of all that is manly to repeated
resistance; a thousand bosoms freely and fearlessly
bared in an instant to whatever of terror there may be
in war and death,&mdash;all these you have witnessed, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
you witness them no more. All is peace. The heights of
yonder metropolis, its towers and roofs, which you then
saw filled with wives and children and countrymen in
distress and terror, and looking with unutterable emotions
for the issue of the combat, have presented you
to-day with the sight of its whole happy population,
come out to welcome and greet you with a universal
jubilee. Yonder proud ships, by a felicity of position
appropriately lying at the foot of this mount, and seeming
fondly to cling around it, are not means of annoyance
to you, but your country&rsquo;s own means of distinction
and defence. All is peace; and God has granted you
this sight of your country&rsquo;s happiness, ere you slumber
in the grave. He has allowed you to behold and to
partake the reward of your patriotic toils; and he has
allowed us, your sons and countrymen, to meet you here,
and in the name of the present generation, in the name
of your country, in the name of liberty, to thank you!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The dead

<p>But, alas! you are not all here! Time and the sword
have thinned your ranks. Prescott, Putnam, Stark,
Brooks, Read, Pomeroy, Bridge! our eyes
seek for you in vain amid this broken band.
You are gathered to your fathers, and live only to your
country in her grateful remembrance and your own
bright example. But let us not too much grieve that
you have met the common fate of men. You lived at
least long enough to know that your work had been
nobly and successfully accomplished. You lived to see
your country&rsquo;s independence established, and to sheathe
your swords from war. On the light of Liberty you
saw arise the light of Peace, like</p>

bands, whom nothing brought hither but the unquenchable
fire of his own spirit! Him! cut off by
Providence in the
hour of overwhelming
anxiety and thick
gloom; falling ere he
saw the star of his
country rise; pouring
out his generous
blood like water, before
he knew whether
it would fertilize a
land of freedom or
of bondage!&mdash;how
shall I struggle with
the emotions that
stifle the utterance
of thy name! Our
poor work may perish;
but thine shall

may moulder away; the soil ground it rests
upon may sink down to a level with the sea; but thy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
memory shall not fail! Wheresoever among men a heart
shall be found that beats to the transports of patriotism
and liberty, its aspirations shall be to claim kindred with
thy spirit!</p>

<p>But the scene amidst which we stand does not permit
us to confine our thoughts or our sympathies to those
fearless spirits who hazarded or lost their lives on this
consecrated spot. We have the happiness to rejoice
here in the presence of a most worthy representation of
the survivors of the whole Revolutionary army.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The veterans
of the Revolution.</div>

<p>Veterans! you are the remnant of many a well-fought
field. You bring with you marks of honor from Trenton
and Monmouth, from Yorktown, Camden,
Bennington, and Saratoga. Veterans
of half a century! when in your youthful
days you put everything at hazard in your country&rsquo;s
cause, good as that cause was, and sanguine as youth is,
still your fondest hopes did not stretch onward to an
hour like this! At a period to which you could not
reasonably have expected to arrive, at a moment of national
prosperity such as you could never have foreseen,
you are now met here to enjoy the fellowship of old
soldiers, and to receive the overflowings of a universal
gratitude.</p>

<p>But your agitated countenances and your heaving
breasts inform me that even this is not an unmixed joy.
I perceive that a tumult of contending feelings rushes
upon you. The images of the dead, as well as the persons
of the living, present themselves before you. The
scene overwhelms you, and I turn from it. May the
Father of all mercies smile upon your declining years,
and bless them! And when you shall here have exchanged
your embraces, when you shall once more have
pressed the hands which have been so often extended to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
give succor in adversity, or grasped in the exultation of
victory, then look abroad upon this lovely land which
your young valor defended, and mark the happiness
with which it is filled; yea, look abroad upon the whole
earth, and see what a name you have contributed to
give to your country, and what a praise you have added
to freedom, and then rejoice in the sympathy and gratitude
which beam upon your last days from the improved
condition of mankind!</p>

<p>Fortunate, fortunate man! with what measure of
devotion will you not thank God for the circumstances
of your extraordinary life! You are connected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
with both hemispheres and with two generations.
Heaven saw fit to ordain that the electric spark of
liberty should be conducted, through you, from the
New World to the Old; and we, who are now here to
perform this duty of patriotism, have all of us long ago
received it in charge from our fathers to cherish your
name and your virtues.
You will account it an instance
of your good fortune,
Sir, that you crossed
the seas to visit us at a
time which enables you to
be present at this solemnity.
You now behold
the field, the renown of
which reached you in
the heart of France, and
caused a thrill in your ardent
bosom. You see the
lines of the little redoubt
thrown up by the incredible
diligence of Prescott;
defended, to the last extremity,
by his lion-hearted valor; and within which the
corner-stone of our monument has now taken its position.
You see where Warren fell, and where Parker,
Gardner, McCleary, Moore, and other early patriots, fell
with him. Those who survived that day, and whose
lives have been prolonged to the present hour, are now
around you. Some of them you have known in the
trying scenes of the war. Behold! they now stretch
forth their feeble arms to embrace you. Behold! they
raise their trembling voices to invoke the blessing of
God on you and yours forever.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir, you have assisted us in laying the foundation of
this structure. You have heard us rehearse, with our
feeble commendation, the names of departed patriots.
Monuments and eulogy belong to the dead. We give
them this day to Warren and his associates. On other
occasions they have been given to your more immediate
companions in arms, to Washington, to Greene, to Gates,
to Sullivan, and to Lincoln. We have become reluctant
to grant these, our highest and last honors, further.
We would gladly hold them yet back from the little
remnant of that immortal band. <i>Serus in c&#339;lum redeas.</i><a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
Illustrious as are your merits, yet far, oh, very far distant
be the day when any inscription shall bear your name,
or any tongue pronounce its eulogy!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The common
progress of
nations.</div>

<p>The leading reflection to which this occasion seems to
invite us respects the great changes which have happened
in the fifty years since the battle of
Bunker Hill was fought. And it peculiarly
marks the character of the present age,
that, in looking at these changes, and in estimating their
effect on our condition, we are obliged to consider, not
what has been done in our own country only, but in
others also. In these interesting times, while nations
are making separate and individual advances in improvement,
they make, too, a common progress; like
vessels on a common tide, propelled by the gales at
different rates, according to their several structure and
management, but all moved forward by one mighty
current, strong enough to bear onward whatever does
not sink beneath it.</p>

<p>A chief distinction of the present day is a community
of opinions and knowledge amongst men in different
nations, existing in a degree heretofore unknown.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Knowledge has, in our time, triumphed, and is triumphing,
over distance, over difference of languages,
over diversity of habits, over prejudice, and over bigotry.
The civilized and Christian world is fast learning
the great lesson, that difference of nation does not imply
necessary hostility, and that all contact need not be war.
The whole world is becoming a common field for intellect
to act in. Energy of mind, genius, power, wheresoever
it exists, may speak out in any tongue, and the
world will hear it. A great chord of sentiment and
feeling runs through two continents, and vibrates over
both. Every breeze wafts intelligence from country to
country; every wave rolls it; all give it forth, and all
in turn receive it. There is a vast commerce of ideas;
there are marts and exchanges for intellectual discoveries,
and a wonderful fellowship of those individual
intelligences which make up the mind and opinion of
the age. Mind is the great lever of all things; human
thought is the process by which human ends are ultimately
answered; and the diffusion of knowledge, so
astonishing in the last half-century, has rendered innumerable
minds, variously gifted by nature, competent to
be competitors or fellow-workers on the theatre of intellectual
operation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Influence of
the American
Revolution
upon
Europe.</div>

<p>The great wheel of political revolution began to move
in America. Here its rotation was guarded, regular,
and safe. Transferred to the other continent,
from unfortunate but natural causes,
it received an irregular and violent impulse;
it whirled along with a fearful celerity; till at
length, like the chariot-wheels in the races of antiquity,
it took fire from the rapidity of its own motion, and
blazed onward, spreading conflagration and terror around.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>We learn from the result of this experiment, how fortunate
was our own condition, and how admirably the
character of our people was calculated for setting the
great example of popular governments. The possession
of power did not turn the heads of the American people,
for they had long been in the habit of exercising a great
degree of self-control. Although the paramount authority
of the parent state existed over them, yet a large
field of legislation had always been open to our Colonial
assemblies. They were accustomed to representative
bodies and the forms of free government; they understood
the doctrine of the division of power among
different branches, and the necessity of checks on each.
The character of our countrymen, moreover, was sober,
moral, and religious; and there was little in the change
to shock their feelings of justice and humanity, or even
to disturb an honest prejudice. We had no domestic
throne to overturn, no privileged orders to cast down,
no violent changes of property to encounter. In the
American Revolution, no man sought or wished for
more than to defend and enjoy his own. None hoped
for plunder or for spoil. Rapacity was unknown to it;
the axe was not among the instruments of its accomplishment;
and we all know that it could not have lived a
single day under any well-founded imputation of possessing
a tendency adverse to the Christian religion.</p>

<p>It need not surprise us, that, under circumstances less
auspicious, political revolutions elsewhere, even when
well intended, have terminated differently. It is, indeed,
a great achievement, it is the master-work of the
world, to establish governments entirely popular on
lasting foundations; nor is it easy, indeed, to introduce
the popular principle at all into governments to which
it has been altogether a stranger. It cannot be doubted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
however, that Europe has come out of the contest, in
which she has been so long engaged, with greatly superior
knowledge, and, in many respects, in a highly
improved condition. Whatever benefit has been acquired
is likely to be retained, for it consists mainly in the acquisition
of more enlightened ideas. And although kingdoms
and provinces may be wrested from the hands that
hold them, in the same manner they were obtained;
although ordinary and vulgar power may, in human
affairs, be lost as it has been won; yet it is the glorious
prerogative of the empire of knowledge, that what it
gains it never loses. On the contrary, it increases by
the multiple of its power; all its ends become means;
all its attainments, helps to new conquests. Its whole
abundant harvest is but so much seed wheat, and nothing
has limited, and nothing can limit the amount of
ultimate product.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The representative
system of
government.</div>

<p>Under the influence of this rapidly increasing knowledge,
the people have begun, in all forms of government,
to think and to reason on affairs of
state. Regarding government as an institution
for the public good, they demand a
knowledge of its operations, and a participation in its
exercise. A call for the representative system, wherever
it is not enjoyed, and where there is already intelligence
enough to estimate its value, is perseveringly
made. Where men may speak out, they demand it;
where the bayonet is at their throats, they pray for it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Respect for
the judgment
of the world.</div>

<p>We may hope that the growing influence of enlightened
sentiment will promote the permanent peace of the
world. Wars to maintain family alliances, to uphold or
to cast down dynasties, and to regulate successions to
thrones, which have occupied so much room in the his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>tory
of modern times, if not less likely to happen at all,
will be less likely to become general and involve many
nations, as the great principle shall be more
and more established, that the interest of the
world is peace, and its first great statute
that every nation possesses the power of establishing a
government for itself. But public opinion has attained
also an influence over governments which do not admit
the popular principle into their organization. A necessary
respect for the judgment of the world operates, in
some measure, as a control over the most unlimited
forms of authority. It is owing, perhaps, to this truth,
that the interesting struggle of the Greeks has been
suffered to go on so long, without a direct interference,
either to wrest that country from its present masters, or
to execute the system of pacification by force, and, with
united strength, lay the neck of Christian and civilized
Greek at the foot of the barbarian Turk. Let us thank
God that we live in an age when something has influence
besides the bayonet, and when the sternest authority
does not venture to encounter the scorching power
of public reproach. Any attempt of the kind I have
mentioned should be met by one universal burst of indignation;
the air of the civilized world ought to be
made too warm to be comfortably breathed by any one
who would hazard it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Greek
struggle
for independence.</div>

<p>It is, indeed, a touching reflection, that, while, in the
fulness of our country&rsquo;s happiness, we rear this monument
to her honor, we look for instruction in
our undertaking to a country which is now in
fearful contest, not for works of art or memorials
of glory, but for her own existence.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Let her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
be assured that she is not forgotten in the world; that
her efforts are applauded, and that constant prayers
ascend for her success. And let us cherish a confident
hope for her final triumph. If the true spark of religious
and civil liberty be kindled, it will burn. Human
agency cannot extinguish it. Like the earth&rsquo;s central
fire, it may be smothered for a time; the ocean
may overwhelm it; mountains may press it down; but
its inherent and unconquerable force will heave both
the ocean and the land, and at some time or other, in
some place or other, the volcano will break out and
flame up to heaven.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">South American
liberty.</div>

<p>When the battle of Bunker Hill was fought, the existence
of South America was scarcely felt in the civilized
world. The thirteen little Colonies of North
America habitually called themselves the
&ldquo;Continent.&rdquo; Borne down by Colonial subjugation,
monopoly, and bigotry, these vast regions of the South
were hardly visible above the horizon. But in our
day there has been, as it were, a new creation. The
southern hemisphere emerges from the sea. Its lofty
mountains begin to lift themselves into the light of
heaven; its broad and fertile plains stretch out, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
beauty, to the eye of civilized man, and at the mighty
bidding of the voice of political liberty the waters of
darkness retire.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The example
of the
republic of
the United
States.</div>

<p>And, now, let us indulge an honest exultation in the
conviction of the benefit which the example of our country
has produced, and is likely to produce, on
human freedom and human happiness. Let
us endeavor to comprehend in all its magnitude,
and to feel in all its importance, the
part assigned to us in the great drama of human affairs.
We are placed at the head of the system of representative
and popular governments. Thus far our example
shows that such governments are compatible not only
with respectability and power, but with repose, with
peace, with security of personal rights, with good laws,
and a just administration.</p>

<p>We are not propagandists. Wherever other systems
are preferred, either as being thought better in themselves,
or as better suited to existing condition, we leave
the preference to be enjoyed. Our history hitherto
proves, however, that the popular form is practicable, and
that with wisdom and knowledge men may govern themselves;
and the duty incumbent on us is to preserve the
consistency of this cheering example, and take care that
nothing may weaken its authority with the world. If,
in our case, the representative system ultimately fail,
popular governments must be pronounced impossible.
No combination of circumstances more favorable to the
experiment can ever be expected to occur. The last
hopes of mankind, therefore, rest with us; and if it
should be proclaimed that our example had become an
argument against the experiment, the knell of popular
liberty would be sounded throughout the earth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>These are excitements to duty; but they are not
suggestions of doubt. Our history and our condition, all
that is gone before us, and all that surrounds us,
authorize the belief that popular governments, though
subject to occasional variations, in form perhaps not
always for the better, may yet, in their general character,
be as durable and permanent as other systems. We
know, indeed, that in our country any other is impossible.
The <i>principle</i> of free governments adheres to the
American soil. It is bedded in it, immovable as its
mountains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The obligations
of
Americans.</div>

<p>And let the sacred obligations which have devolved
on this generation, and on us, sink deep into our hearts.
Those who established our liberty and our
government are daily dropping from among
us. The great trust now descends to new
hands. Let us apply ourselves to that which is presented
to us, as our appropriate object. We can win no
laurels in a war for independence. Earlier and worthier
hands have gathered them all. Nor are there places for
us by the side of Solon, and Alfred, and other founders
of states. Our fathers have filled them. But there
remains to us a great duty of defence and preservation;
and there is open to us, also, a noble pursuit, to which
the spirit of the times strongly invites us. Our proper
business is improvement. Let our age be the age of
improvement. In a day of peace, let us advance the
arts of peace and the works of peace. Let us develop
the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up
its institutions, promote all its great interests, and see
whether we also, in our day and generation, may not
perform something worthy to be remembered. Let us
cultivate a true spirit of union and harmony. In pursuing
the great objects which our condition points out to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
us, let us act under a settled conviction, and an habitual
feeling, that these twenty-four States are one country.
Let our conceptions be enlarged to the circle of our
duties. Let us extend our ideas over the whole of the
vast field in which we are called to act. Let our object
be, <small>OUR COUNTRY, OUR WHOLE COUNTRY, AND NOTHING BUT
OUR COUNTRY</small>. And, by the blessing of God, may that
country itself become a vast and splendid monument,
not of oppression and terror, but of Wisdom, of Peace,
and of Liberty, upon which the world may gaze with
admiration forever!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[It was determined by the directors of the
Bunker Hill Monument Association, that
the completion of the work should be celebrated
in a manner not less imposing than
that in which the laying of the corner-stone
had been celebrated, seventeen years before.
The co-operation of Mr. Webster
was again invited, and, notwithstanding the
pressure of his engagements as Secretary
of State at Washington, was again patriotically
yielded. The President of the United
States and his Cabinet had accepted invitations
to be present; and delegations of
the descendants of New England attended
from all parts of the Union, including one
hundred and eight surviving veterans of the
Revolution, among whom were some who
were in the battle of Bunker Hill. According
to the estimate of Richard Frothingham,
one hundred thousand persons were
gathered, and nearly half that number are
supposed to have been within the reach of the orator&rsquo;s voice. The
ground rises slightly between the platform and the Monument Square,
so that the whole of this concourse, compactly crowded together, was
within the full view of the speaker. When, after saying, &ldquo;It is not
from my lips, it could not be from any human lips, that that strain of
eloquence is this day to flow most competent to move and excite the
vast multitudes around me,&mdash;the powerful speaker stands motionless
before us,&rdquo; Mr. Webster paused, and pointed to the monument, the
audience burst into long and loud applause. It was some moments
before he could go on with his address.]</p></div>

<p>A duty has been performed. A work of gratitude and
patriotism is completed. This structure, having its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
foundations in soil which drank deep of early Revolutionary
blood, has at length reached its destined height,
and now lifts its summit to the skies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The changes
of eighteen
years.</div>

<p>Time and nature have had their course in diminishing
the number of those whom we met here on the 17th of
June, 1825. Most of the Revolutionary characters
then present have since deceased; and
Lafayette sleeps in his native land.  Yet the
name and blood of Warren are with us; the kindred of
Putnam are also here; and near me, universally beloved
for his character and his virtues, and now venerable for
his years, sits the son of the noble-hearted and daring
Prescott.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The purpose
of the
monument.</div>

<p>The Bunker Hill Monument is finished. Here it
stands.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Fortunate in the high natural eminence on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
which it is placed, higher, infinitely higher in its objects
and purpose, it rises over the land and over the sea; and
visible at their homes to three hundred thousand
of the people of Massachusetts, it stands
a memorial of the last, and a monitor to the
present, and to all succeeding generations. I have
spoken of the loftiness of its purpose. If it had been
without any other design than the creation of a work of
art, the granite of which it is composed would have
slept in its native bed. It has a purpose, and that
purpose gives it its character. That purpose enrobes
it with dignity and moral grandeur. That well-known
purpose it is which causes us to look up to it with a
feeling of awe. It is itself the orator of this occasion.
It is not from my lips, it could not be from any human
lips, that that strain of eloquence is this day to flow
most competent to move and excite the vast multitudes
around me. The powerful speaker stands motionless
before us. It is a plain shaft. It bears no inscriptions,
fronting to the rising sun, from which the future antiquary
shall wipe the dust. Nor does the rising sun
cause tones of music to issue from its summit. But at
the rising of the sun, and at the setting of the sun; in
the blaze of noonday, and beneath the milder effulgence
of lunar light; it looks, it speaks, it acts, to the full
comprehension of every American mind, and the awakening
of glowing enthusiasm in every American heart.
Its silent, but awful utterance; its deep pathos, as it
brings to our contemplation the 17th of June, 1775, and
the consequences which have resulted to us, to our
country, and to the world, from the events of that day,
and which we know must continue to rain influence on
the destinies of mankind to the end of time; the elevation
with which it raises us high above the ordinary feel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>ings
of life,&mdash;surpass all that the study of the closet, or
even the inspiration of genius, can produce. To-day it
speaks to us. Its future auditories will be the successive
generations of men, as they rise up before it and gather
around it. Its speech will be of patriotism and courage;
of civil and religious liberty; of free government; of
the moral improvement and elevation of mankind; and
of the immortal memory of those who, with heroic devotion,
have sacrificed their lives for their country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The monuments
of the
past.</div>

<p>In the older world, numerous fabrics still exist,
reared by human hands, but whose object has been lost
in the darkness of ages.  They are now
monuments of nothing but the labor and
skill which constructed them.</p>

<p>The mighty pyramid itself, half buried in the sands
of Africa, has nothing to bring down and report to us
but the power of kings and the servitude of the people.
If it had any purpose beyond that of a mausoleum, such
purpose has perished from history and from tradition.
If asked for its moral object, its admonition, its sentiment,
its instruction to mankind, or any high end in its
erection, it is silent; silent as the millions which lie in
the dust at its base, and in the catacombs which surround
it. Without a just moral object, therefore, made
known to man, though raised against the skies, it excites
only conviction of power, mixed with strange
wonder. But if the civilization of the present race of
men, founded, as it is, in solid science, the true knowledge
of nature, and vast discoveries in art, and which is
elevated and purified by moral sentiment and by the
truths of Christianity, be not destined to destruction
before the final termination of human existence on earth,
the object and purpose of this edifice will be known
till that hour shall come. And even if civilization<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
should be subverted, and the truths of the Christian
religion obscured by a new deluge of barbarism, the
memory of Bunker Hill and the American Revolution
will still be elements and parts of the knowledge
which shall be possessed
by the last man
to whom the light of
civilization and Christianity
shall be extended.</p>

<p>This celebration is
honored by the presence

Union. An occasion
so national in its object
and character,
and so much connected
with that Revolution
from which the government
sprang at the
head of which he is
placed, may well receive
from him this mark of attention and respect. Well
acquainted with Yorktown, the scene of the last great
military struggle of the Revolution, his eye
now surveys the field of Bunker Hill, the
theatre of the first of those important conflicts. He sees
where Warren fell, where Putnam, and Prescott, and
Stark, and Knowlton, and Brooks fought. He beholds
the spot where a thousand trained soldiers of England
were smitten to the earth, in the first effort of revolutionary
war, by the arm of a bold and determined
yeomanry, contending for liberty and their country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Visitors
present at
the dedication.</div>

<p>Banners and badges, processions and flags, announce
to us, that amidst this uncounted throng are thousands
of natives of New England now residents in
other States. Welcome, ye kindred names,
with kindred blood! From the broad savannas
of the South, from the newer regions of the West,
from amidst the hundreds of thousands of men of Eastern
origin who cultivate the rich valley of the Genesee
or live along the chain of the lakes, from the mountains
of Pennsylvania, and from the thronged cities of the
coast, welcome, welcome! Wherever else you may be
strangers, here you are all at home. You assemble at
this shrine of liberty, near the family altars at which
your earliest devotions were paid to Heaven, near to
the temples of worship first entered by you, and near
to the schools and colleges in which your education was
received. You come hither with a glorious ancestry of
liberty. You bring names which are on the rolls of
Lexington, Concord, and Bunker Hill. You come,
some of you, once more to be embraced by an aged Revolutionary
father, or to receive another, perhaps a last,
blessing, bestowed in love and tears by a mother yet
surviving to witness and to enjoy your prosperity and
happiness.</p>

<p>But if family associations and the recollections of the
past bring you hither with greater alacrity, and mingle
with your greeting much of local attachment and private
affection, greeting also be given, free and hearty
greeting, to every American citizen who treads this
sacred soil with patriotic feeling, and respires with
pleasure in an atmosphere perfumed with the recollections
of 1775! This occasion is respectable, nay, it is
grand, it is sublime, by the nationality of its sentiment.
Among the seventeen millions of happy people who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
form the American community there is not one who has
not an interest in this monument, as there is not one
that has not a deep and abiding interest in that which
it commemorates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The American
Union.</div>

<p>Woe betide the man who brings to this day&rsquo;s worship
feeling less than wholly American! Woe betide the
man who can stand here with the fires of
local resentments burning, or the purpose of
fomenting local jealousies and the strifes of local interests
festering and rankling in his heart! Union, established
in justice, in patriotism, and the most plain
and obvious common interest,&mdash;union, founded on the
same love of liberty, cemented by blood shed in the
same common cause,&mdash;union has been the source of all
our glory and greatness thus far, and is the ground of
all our highest hopes. This column stands on Union.
I know not that it might not keep its position, if the
American Union, in the mad conflict of human passions,
and in the strife of parties and factions, should be broken
up and destroyed. I know not that it would totter
and fall to the earth, and mingle its fragments with the
fragments of Liberty and the Constitution, when state
should be separated from state, and faction and dismemberment
obliterate forever all the hopes of the founders
of our republic, and the great inheritance of their children.
It might stand. But who, from beneath the
weight of mortification and shame that would oppress

not be seared by such a spectacle? For my part, should
I live to such a time, I shall avert my eyes from it forever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance
of the battle
of Bunker
Hill.</div>

<p>It is not as a mere military encounter of hostile
armies that the battle of Bunker Hill presents its
principal claim to attention. Yet even as a mere battle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
there were circumstances attending it extraordinary in
character, and entitling it to peculiar distinction.
It was fought on this eminence; in the neighborhood
of yonder city; in the presence of
many more spectators than there were combatants
in the conflict. Men, women, and children,
from every commanding position, were gazing at the
battle, and looking for its results with all the eagerness
natural to those who knew that the issue was fraught
with the deepest consequences to themselves, personally,
as well as to their country. Yet, on the 16th of June,
1775, there was nothing around this hill but verdure and
culture. There was, indeed, the note of awful preparation
in Boston. There was the Provincial army at
Cambridge, with its right flank resting on Dorchester,
and its left on Chelsea. But here all was peace. Tranquillity
reigned around. On the 17th, everything was
changed. On this eminence had arisen, in the night, a
redoubt, built by Prescott, and in which he held command.
Perceived by the enemy at dawn, it was immediately
cannonaded from the floating batteries in the
river, and from the opposite shore. And then ensued
the hurried movement in Boston, and soon the troops of
Britain embarked in the attempt to dislodge the Colonists.
In an hour everything indicated an immediate
and bloody conflict. Love of liberty on one side, proud
defiance of rebellion on the other, hopes and fears, and
courage and daring, on both sides, animated the hearts
of the combatants as they hung on the edge of battle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The motive
for the
engagement.</div>

<p>I suppose it would be difficult, in a military point of
view, to ascribe to the leaders on either side any just
motive for the engagement which followed. On the
one hand, it could not have been very important to
the Americans to attempt to hem the British within the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
town, by advancing one single post a quarter of a mile;
while, on the other hand, if the British found it essential
to dislodge the American troops, they
had it in their power at no expense of life.
By moving up their ships and batteries, they
could have completely cut off all communication with
the mainland over the Neck, and the forces in the
redoubt would have been reduced to a state of famine in
forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>But that was not the day for any such consideration
on either side! Both parties were anxious to try the
strength of their arms. The pride of England would
not permit the rebels, as she termed them, to defy her to
the teeth; and, without for a moment calculating the
cost, the British general determined to destroy the fort
immediately. On the other side, Prescott and his gallant
followers longed and thirsted for a decisive trial of
strength and of courage. They wished a battle, and
wished it at once. And this is the true secret of the
movements on this hill.</p>

<p>I will not attempt to describe that battle. The cannonading;
the landing of the British; their advance;
the coolness with which the charge was met; the repulse;
the second attack; the second repulse; the burning of
Charlestown; and, finally, the closing assault, and the
slow retreat of the Americans,&mdash;the history of all these
is familiar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The consequences
of
the battle.</div>

<p>But the consequences of the battle of Bunker Hill
were greater than those of any ordinary conflict, although
between armies of far greater force, and terminating with
more immediate advantage on the one side or the other.
It was the first great battle of the Revolution; and not
only the first blow, but the blow which determined the
contest. It did not, indeed, put an end to the war,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
but in the then existing hostile state of feeling, the
difficulties could only be referred to the arbitration of the
sword. And one thing is certain: that after
the New England troops had shown themselves
able to face and repulse the regulars,
it was decided that peace never could be established,
but upon the basis of the independence of the Colonies.
When the sun of that day went down, the event of
Independence was no longer doubtful. In a few days
Washington heard of the battle, and he inquired if the
militia had stood the fire of the regulars. When told
that they had not only stood that fire, but reserved their
own till the enemy was within eight rods, and then
poured it in with tremendous effect, &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; exclaimed
he, &ldquo;the liberties of the country are safe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The purposes
of the
Pilgrims of
Plymouth.</div>

<p>The Mayflower sought our shores under no high-wrought
spirit of commercial adventure, no love of gold,
no mixture of purpose warlike or hostile to
any human being. Like the dove from the
ark she had put forth only to find rest. Solemn
supplications on the shore of the sea, in
Holland, had invoked for her, at her departure, the
blessings of Providence. The stars which guided her
were the unobscured constellations of civil and religious
liberty. Her deck was the altar of the living God.
Fervent prayers on bended knees mingled, morning and
evening, with the voices of ocean, and the sighing of the
wind in her shrouds. Every prosperous breeze which,
gently swelling her sails, helped the Pilgrims onward in
their course, awoke new anthems of praise; and when
the elements were wrought into fury, neither the tempest,
tossing their fragile bark like a feather, nor the
darkness and howling of the midnight storm, ever dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>turbed,
in man or woman, the firm and settled purpose
of their souls, to undergo all, and to do all, that the
meekest patience, the boldest resolution, and the highest
trust in God could enable human beings to suffer or to
perform.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">English
liberty and
Spanish
greed.</div>

<p>The Colonists of English America were of the people,
and a people already free. They were of the middle, industrious,
and already prosperous class, the
inhabitants of commercial and manufacturing
cities, among whom liberty first revived and
respired, after a sleep of a thousand years in
the bosom of the Dark Ages. Spain descended on the
New World in the armed and terrible image of her monarchy
and her soldiery; England approached it in the
winning and popular garb of personal rights, public
protection, and civil freedom. England transplanted
liberty to America; Spain transplanted power. England,
through the agency of private companies and the
efforts of individuals, colonized this part of North America
by industrious individuals, making their own way in
the wilderness, defending themselves against the savages,
recognizing their right to the soil, and with a general
honest purpose of introducing knowledge as well
as Christianity among them. Spain stooped on South
America like a vulture on its prey. Everything was
force. Territories were acquired by fire and sword.
Cities were destroyed by fire and sword. Hundreds of
thousands of human beings fell by fire and sword. Even
conversion to Christianity was attempted by fire and
sword.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The consequences
of
the two
principles.</div>

<p>Behold, then, fellow-citizens, the difference resulting
from the operation of the two principles! Here, to-day,
on the summit of Bunker Hill, and at the foot of this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>monument, behold the difference! I would that the
fifty thousand voices present could proclaim it with a
shout which should be heard over the globe.
Our inheritance was of liberty, secured and
regulated by law, and enlightened by religion
and knowledge; that of South America was
of power, stern, unrelenting, tyrannical, military power.
And now look to the consequences of the two principles
on the general and aggregate happiness of the human
race. Behold the results in all the regions conquered by
Cort&eacute;z and Pizarro, and the contrasted results here. I
suppose the territory of the United States may amount
to one-eighth, or one-tenth, of that colonized by Spain
on this continent; and yet in all that vast region there
are but between one and two millions of people of European
color and European blood, while in the United
States there are fourteen millions who rejoice in their
descent from the people of the more northern part of
Europe.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The seeds of
government
sown by the
Colonists.</div>

<p>The great elements of the American system of government,
originally introduced by the Colonists, and which
were early in operation, and ready to be developed,
more and more, as the progress of
events should justify or demand, were,&mdash;</p>

<p>Escape from the existing political systems
of Europe, including its religious hierarchies, but the
continued possession and enjoyment of its science and
arts, its literature, and its manners;</p>

<p>Home government, or the power of making in the
Colony the municipal laws which were to govern it;</p>

<p>Equality of rights;</p>

<p>Representative assemblies, or forms of government
founded on popular elections.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">American
institutions.</div>

<p>Few topics are more inviting, or more fit for philosophical
discussion, than the effect on the happiness of
mankind of institutions founded upon these
principles; or, in other words, the influence
of the New World upon the Old.</p>

<p>Her obligations to Europe for science and art, laws,
literature, and manners, America acknowledges, as she
ought, with respect and gratitude. The people of the
United States, descendants of the English stock, grateful
for the treasures of knowledge derived from their
English ancestors, admit also, with thanks and filial regard,
that among those ancestors, under the culture of
Hampden and Sydney and other assiduous friends, that
seed of popular liberty first germinated which on our soil
has shot up to its full height, until its branches overshadow
all the land.</p>

<div class="sidenote">America&rsquo;s
contributions
to European
welfare.</div>

<p>But America has not failed to make returns. If she
has not wholly cancelled the obligation, or equalled it by
others of like weight, she has, at least, made
respectable advances towards repaying the
debt. And she admits that, standing in the
midst of civilized nations, and in a civilized
age, a nation among nations, there is a high part which
she is expected to act, for the general advancement of
human interests and human welfare.</p>

<p>American mines have filled the mints of Europe with
the precious metals. The productions of the American
soil and climate have poured out their abundance of luxuries
for the tables of the rich, and of necessaries for the
sustenance of the poor. Birds and animals of beauty
and value have been added to the European stocks; and
transplantations from the unequalled riches of our forests
have mingled themselves profusely with the elms,
and ashes, and Druidical oaks of England.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>America has made contributions to Europe far more
important. Who can estimate the amount, or the value,
of the augmentation of the commerce of the world that
has resulted from America? Who can imagine to himself
what would now be the shock to the Eastern Continent,
if the Atlantic were no longer traversable, or if
there were no longer American productions or American
markets?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The American
example.</div>

<p>But America exercises influences, or holds out
examples, for the consideration of the Old World, of a
much higher, because they are of a moral
and political character.</p>

<p>America has furnished to Europe proof of the fact
that popular institutions, founded on equality and the
principle of representation, are capable of maintaining
governments able to secure the rights of person, property,
and reputation.</p>

<p>America has proved that it is practicable to elevate
the mass of mankind,&mdash;that portion which in Europe
is called the laboring, or lower class;&mdash;to raise them
to self-respect, to make them competent to act a part in
the great right and great duty of self-government; and
she has proved that this may be done by education and
the diffusion of knowledge. She holds out an example,
a thousand times more encouraging than ever was presented
before, to those nine-tenths of the human race
who are born without hereditary fortune or hereditary
rank.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The character
of
Washington.</div>

<p>America has furnished to the world the character of
Washington! And if our American institutions
had done nothing else, that alone would
have entitled them to the respect of mankind.</p>

<p>Washington! &ldquo;First in war, first in peace, and first
in the hearts of his countrymen!&rdquo; Washington is all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
our own! The enthusiastic veneration and regard in
which the people of the United States hold him, prove
them to be worthy of such a countryman; while his
reputation abroad reflects the highest honor on his
country. I would cheerfully put the question to-day to
the intelligence of Europe and the world, what character
of the century, upon the whole, stands out, in the relief
of history, most pure, most respectable, most sublime;
and I doubt not that, by a suffrage approaching to
unanimity, the answer would be Washington!</p>

<p>The structure now standing before us, by its uprightness,
its solidity, its durability, is no unfit emblem of
his character. His public virtues and public principles
were as firm as the earth on which it stands; his personal
motives as pure as the serene heaven in which its
summit is lost. But, indeed, though a fit, it is an inadequate
emblem. Towering high above the column
which our hands have builded; beheld, not by the
inhabitants of a single city or a single State, but by all
the families of man, ascends the colossal grandeur of
the character and life of Washington. In all the constituents
of the one, in all the acts of the other, in all
its titles to immortal love, admiration, and renown, it
is an American production. It is the embodiment and
vindication of our transatlantic liberty. Born upon
our soil, of parents also born upon it; never for a
moment having had sight of the Old World; instructed,
according to the modes of his time, only in the spare,
plain, but wholesome elementary knowledge which our
institutions provide for the children of the people;
growing up beneath, and penetrated by, the genuine
influences of American society; living from infancy
to manhood and age amidst our expanding but not
luxurious civilization; partaking in our great destiny
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
of labor, our long contest with unreclaimed nature and
uncivilized man, our agony of glory, the war of Independence,
our great victory of peace, the formation of
the Union, and the establishment of the Constitution,&mdash;he
is all, all our own! Washington is ours. That
crowded and glorious life,&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Where multitudes of virtues passed along,<br />
Each pressing foremost, in the mighty throng<br />
Ambitious to be seen, then making room<br />
For greater multitudes that were to come,&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">that life was the life of an American citizen.</p>

<p>I claim him for America. In all the perils, in every
darkened moment of the state, in the midst of the
reproaches of enemies and the misgiving of friends, I
turn to that transcendent name for courage and for
consolation. To him who denies or doubts whether our
fervid liberty can be combined with law, with order,
with the security of property, with the pursuits and
advancement of happiness; to him who denies that our
forms of government are capable of producing exaltation
of soul, and the passion of true glory; to him who denies
that we have contributed anything to the stock of
great lessons and great examples;&mdash;to all these I reply
by pointing to Washington!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And now, friends and fellow-citizens, it is time to
bring this discourse to a close.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The obligations
of
Americans.</div>

<p>We have indulged in gratifying recollections of the
past, in the prosperity and pleasures of the present, and
in high hopes for the future. But let us
remember that we have duties and obligations
to perform, corresponding to the blessings
which we enjoy. Let us remember the trust, the sacred
trust, attaching to the rich inheritance which we have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
received from our fathers. Let us feel our personal
responsibility, to the full extent of our power and
influence, for the preservation of the principles of civil
and religious liberty. And let us remember that it is
only religion, and morals, and knowledge, that can
make men respectable and happy, under any form of
government. Let us hold fast the great truth, that
communities are responsible, as well as individuals;
that no government is respectable which is not just;
that without unspotted purity of public faith, without
sacred public principle, fidelity, and honor, no mere
forms of government, no machinery of laws, can give
dignity to political society. In our day and generation
let us seek to raise and improve the moral sentiment,
so that we may look not for a degraded, but for an
elevated and improved future. And when both we and
our children shall have been consigned to the house
appointed for all living, may love of country and pride
of country glow with equal fervor among those to whom
our names and our blood shall have descended! And
then, when honored and decrepit age shall lean against
the base of this monument, and troops of ingenuous
youth shall be gathered round it, and when the one
shall speak to the other of its objects, the purposes of
its construction, and the great and glorious events with
which it is connected, there shall rise from every youthful
breast the ejaculation, &ldquo;Thank God, I&mdash;I also&mdash;<span class="smcap">am
an American!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="ADAMS_AND_JEFFERSON" id="ADAMS_AND_JEFFERSON"></a>ADAMS AND JEFFERSON</h2>

<p class="center">A DISCOURSE IN COMMEMORATION OF THE LIVES AND
SERVICES OF JOHN ADAMS AND THOMAS JEFFERSON;
DELIVERED IN FANEUIL HALL, BOSTON,
AUGUST 2, 1826</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[Since the death of Washington, on the 14th of December, 1799, the
public mind had never been so powerfully affected by any similar
event as by the death of John Adams, on the 4th of July, 1826. The
news reached Boston in the evening of that day. It acquired a singular
interest from the year and the day on which it took place;&mdash;the
4th of July of the year completing the half-century from the Declaration
of Independence, a measure in which Mr. Adams himself had
taken so distinguished a part. The emotions of the public were greatly
increased by the indications given by Mr. Adams in his last hours, that
he was fully aware that the day was the anniversary of Independence,
and by his dying allusion to the supposed fact that his colleague,
Jefferson, survived him. When, in the course of a few days, the news
arrived from Virginia, that Jefferson also had died on the same day
and a few hours before Mr. Adams, the patriotic emotions of the country
at large were touched beyond all example. The occurrence was
justly deemed without a parallel in history. The various circumstances
of association and coincidence which marked the characters
and careers of these great men, and especially their simultaneous
decease on the 4th of July, were dwelt upon with deep interest. The
circles of private life, the press, public bodies, and the pulpit, were
for some time almost engrossed with the topic; and exercises of
commemoration were held throughout the country.]</p></div>

<p>This is an unaccustomed spectacle. For the first time,
fellow-citizens, badges of mourning shroud the columns
and overhang the arches of this hall. These walls,
which were consecrated, so long ago, to the cause of
American liberty, which witnessed her infant struggles,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and rung with the shouts of her earliest victories, proclaim,
now, that distinguished friends and champions of
that great cause have fallen. It is right that it should
be thus. The tears which flow, and the honors that are
paid, when the founders of the republic die, give hope
that the republic itself
may be immortal. It
is fit that, by public
assembly and solemn
observance, by anthem
and by eulogy, we commemorate
the services
of national benefactors,
extol their virtues, and
render thanks to God
for eminent blessings,
early given and long
continued, through
their agency, to our
favored country.</p>

<span class="caption"><i>Faneuil Hall.</i></span>
</div>

<p>Adams and Jefferson are no more; and we are assembled,
fellow-citizens, the aged, the middle-aged, and the
young, by the spontaneous impulse of all, under the
authority of the municipal government, with the presence
of the chief magistrate of the Commonwealth, and
others its official representatives, the University, and
the learned societies, to bear our part in those manifestations
of respect and gratitude which pervade the
whole land. Adams and Jefferson are no more. On
our fiftieth anniversary, the great day of national
jubilee, in the very hour of public rejoicing, in the
midst of echoing and re-echoing voices of thanksgiving,
while their own names were on all tongues, they took
their flight together to the world of spirits.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">An epic consummation.</div>

<p>If it be true that no one can safely be pronounced
happy while he lives, if that event which terminates
life can alone crown its honors and its glory,
what felicity is here! The great epic of their
lives, how happily concluded! Poetry itself has hardly
terminated illustrious lives, and finished the career of
earthly renown, by such a consummation. If we had
the power, we could not wish to reverse this dispensation
of the Divine Providence. The great objects of
life were accomplished, the drama was ready to be
closed. It has closed; our patriots have fallen; but so
fallen, at such age, with such coincidence, on such
a day, that we cannot rationally lament that the end has
come which we knew could not be long deferred.</p>

<p>Neither of these great men, fellow-citizens, could
have died, at any time, without leaving an immense
void in our American society. They have been so intimately,
and for so long a time, blended with the
history of the country, and especially so united, in our
thoughts and recollections, with the events of the
Revolution, that the death of either would have touched
the chords of public sympathy. We should have felt
that one great link connecting us with former times
was broken; that we had lost something more, as it
were, of the presence of the Revolution itself, and of
the act of independence, and were driven on, by another
great remove from the days of our country&rsquo;s early distinction,
to meet posterity, and to mix with the future.
Like the mariner, whom the currents of the ocean and
the winds carry along, till he sees the stars which have
directed his course and lighted his pathless way descend,
one by one, beneath the rising horizon, we should have
felt that the stream of time had borne us onward till
another great luminary, whose light had cheered us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
and whose guidance we had followed, had sunk away
from our sight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The remarkable
similarity
between
Adams and
Jefferson in
their lives
and in their
deaths.</div>

<p>But the concurrence of their death on the anniversary
of Independence has naturally awakened stronger emotions.
Both had been Presidents, both had
lived to great age, both were early patriots,
and both were distinguished and ever honored
by their immediate agency in the act of independence.
It cannot but seem striking and
extraordinary that these two should live to
see the fiftieth year from the date of that act; that they
should complete that year; and that then, on the day
which had fast linked forever their own fame with their
country&rsquo;s glory, the heavens should open to receive
them both at once. As their lives themselves were the
gifts of Providence, who is not willing to recognize
in their happy termination, as well as in their long continuance,
proofs that our country and its benefactors
are objects of His care?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their
example.</div>

<p>Adams and Jefferson, I have said, are no more. As
human beings, indeed, they are no more. They are no
more, as in 1776, bold and fearless advocates
of independence; no more, as at subsequent
periods, the head of the government; no more, as we
have recently seen them, aged and venerable objects of
admiration and regard. They are no more. They are
dead. But how little is there of the great and good
which can die! To their country they yet live, and
live forever. They live in all that perpetuates the
remembrance of men on earth; in the recorded proofs
of their own great actions, in the offspring of their
intellect, in the deep-engraved lines of public gratitude,
and in the respect and homage of mankind. They live
in their example; and they live, emphatically, and will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
live, in the influence which their lives and efforts, their
principles and opinions, now exercise, and will continue
to exercise, on the affairs of men, not only in their own
country, but throughout the civilized world. A superior
and commanding human intellect, a truly great man,
when Heaven vouchsafes so rare a gift, is not a temporary
flame, burning brightly for a while, and then giving
place to returning darkness. It is rather a spark of
fervent heat, as well as radiant light, with power to
enkindle the common mass of human mind; so that
when it glimmers in its own decay, and finally goes out
in death, no night follows; but it leaves the world all
light, all on fire, from the potent contact of its own
spirit. Bacon died; but the human understanding,
roused by the touch of his miraculous wand to a perception
of the true philosophy and the just mode of
inquiring after truth, has kept on its course successfully
and gloriously. Newton died; yet the courses
of the spheres are still known, and they yet move on
by the laws which he discovered, and in the orbits
which he saw, and described for them, in the infinity
of space.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their work.</div>

<p>No two men now live, fellow-citizens, perhaps it may
be doubted whether any two men have ever lived in one
age, who, more than those we now commemorate,
have impressed on mankind their own
sentiments in regard to politics and government, infused
their own opinions more deeply into the opinions of
others, or given a more lasting direction to the current
of human thought. Their work doth not perish with
them. The tree which they assisted to plant will
flourish, although they water it and protect it no longer;
for it has struck its roots deep, it has sent them to the
very centre; no storm, not of force to burst the orb,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
can overturn it; its branches spread wide; they stretch
their protecting arms broader and broader, and its top is
destined to reach the heavens. We are not deceived.
There is no delusion here. No age will come in which
the American Revolution will appear less than it is, one
of the greatest events in human history. No age will
come in which it shall cease to be seen and felt, on
either continent, that a mighty step, a great advance,
not only in American affairs, but in human affairs, was
made on the 4th of July, 1776. And no age will come,

acknowledge the efficient agency of those we now honor
in producing that momentous event.</p>

<p>We are not assembled, therefore, fellow-citizens, as
men overwhelmed with calamity by the sudden disruption
of the ties of friendship or affection, or as in despair
for the republic by the untimely blighting of its hopes.
Death has not surprised us by an unseasonable blow.
We have, indeed, seen the tomb close, but it has
closed only over mature years, over long-protracted
public service, over the weakness of age, and over life
itself only when the ends of living had been fulfilled.
These suns, as they rose slowly and steadily, amidst
clouds and storms, in their ascendant, so they have
not rushed from their meridian to sink suddenly in
the west. Like the mildness, the serenity, the continuing
benignity of a summer&rsquo;s day, they have gone down
with slow-descending, grateful, long-lingering light;
and now that they are beyond the visible margin of the
world, good omens cheer us from &ldquo;the bright track of
their fiery car&rdquo;!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Adams the
chief advocate
of the
Declaration
of Independence.</div>

<div class="sidenote">His
education.</div>

<p>John Adams was born at Quincy, then part of the
ancient town of Braintree, on the nineteenth day of
October (Old Style), 1735.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> He was a descendant
of the Puritans, his ancestors having
early emigrated from England, and settled in
Massachusetts. Discovering in childhood a
strong love of reading and of knowledge, together
with marks of great strength and activity of mind,
proper care was taken by his worthy father to provide
for his education. He pursued his youthful
studies in Braintree, under Mr. Marsh, a
teacher whose fortune it was that Josiah Quincy, Jr.,
as well as the subject of these remarks, should receive
from him his instruction in the rudiments of classical
literature. Having been admitted, in 1751, a member
of Harvard College, Mr. Adams was graduated, in
course, in 1755; and on the catalogue of that institution,
his name, at the time of his death, was second
among the living Alumni, being preceded only by that
of the venerable Holyoke. With what degree of reputation
he left the University is not now precisely known.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
We know only that he was distinguished in a class which
numbered Locke and Hemmenway among its members.</p>

<span class="caption"><i>John Adams.</i></span>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Studies law.</div>

<p>Choosing the law for his profession, he commenced
and prosecuted its studies at Worcester, under the direction
of Samuel Putnam, a gentleman whom
he has himself described as an acute man, an
able and learned lawyer, and as being in large professional
practice at that time. In 1758 he was admitted
to the bar, and entered upon the practice of the law in
Braintree. He is understood to have made his first considerable
effort, or to have
attained his first signal
success, at Plymouth, on
one of those occasions
which furnish the earliest
opportunity for distinction
to many young men
of the profession, a jury
trial, and a criminal cause.
His business naturally
grew with his reputation,
and his residence in the
vicinity afforded the opportunity,
as his growing
eminence gave the power,
of entering on a larger
field of practice in the capital. In 1766 he removed
his residence to Boston, still continuing his attendance
on the neighboring circuits, and not unfrequently called
to remote parts of the Province. In 1770 his professional
firmness was brought to a test of some severity, on the application
of the British officers and soldiers to undertake
their defence, on the trial of the indictments found against
them on account of the transactions of the memorable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
5th of March.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> He seems to have thought, on this occasion,
that a man can no more abandon the proper duties
of his profession, than he can abandon other duties.
The event proved that as he judged well for his own
reputation, so, too, he judged well for the interest and
permanent fame of his country. The result of that trial
proved that notwithstanding the high degree of excitement
then existing in consequence of the measures of
the British government, a jury of Massachusetts would
not deprive the most reckless enemies, even the officers
of that standing army quartered among them, which
they so perfectly abhorred, of any part of that protection
which the law, in its mildest and most indulgent
interpretation, affords to persons accused of crimes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An early
prophecy.</div>

<p>Without following Mr. Adams&rsquo;s professional course
further, suffice it to say, that on the first establishment
of the judicial tribunals under the authority of the State,
in 1776, he received an offer of the high and responsible
station of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of
Massachusetts. But he was destined for another and
a different career. From early life the bent of his mind
was toward politics; a propensity which the state of the
times, if it did not create, doubtless very much strengthened.
Public subjects must have occupied the thoughts
and filled up the conversation in the circles in which he
then moved; and the interesting questions at that time
just arising could not but seize on a mind
like his, ardent, sanguine, and patriotic.
A letter, fortunately preserved, written by him at
Worcester, so early as the 12th of October, 1755, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
a proof of very comprehensive views, and uncommon
depth of reflection, in a young man not yet quite twenty.
In this letter he predicted the transfer of power, and the
establishment of a new seat of empire in America; he
predicted, also, the increase of population in the Colonies;
and anticipated their naval distinction, and foretold
that all Europe combined could not subdue them. All
this is said, not on a public occasion or for effect, but
in the style of sober and friendly correspondence, as the
result of his own thoughts. &ldquo;I sometimes retire,&rdquo; said
he, at the close of the letter, &ldquo;and, laying things together,
form some reflections pleasing to myself. The
produce of one of these reveries you have read above.&rdquo;
This prognostication so early in his own life, so early in
the history of the country, of independence, of vast
increase of numbers, of naval force, of such augmented
power as might defy all Europe, is remarkable. It is
more remarkable that its author should live to see fulfilled
to the letter what could have seemed to others, at
the time, but the extravagance of youthful fancy. His
earliest political feelings were thus strongly American,
and from this ardent attachment to his native soil he
never departed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">James Otis.</div>

<p>While still living at Quincy, and at the age of
twenty-four, Mr. Adams was present, in this town, at
the argument before the Supreme Court respecting
Writs of Assistance,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and heard the
celebrated and patriotic speech of James Otis. Unquestionably,
that was a masterly performance. No
flighty declamation about liberty, no superficial discussion
of popular topics, it was a learned, penetrating,
convincing, constitutional argument, expressed in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
strain of high and resolute patriotism. He grasped
the question then pending between England and her
Colonies with the strength of a lion; and if he sometimes
sported, it was only because the lion himself is
sometimes playful. Its success appears to have been as
great as its merits, and its impression was widely felt.
Mr. Adams himself seems
never to have lost the
feeling it produced, and
to have entertained constantly
the fullest conviction
of its important
effects. &ldquo;I do say,&rdquo; he
observes, &ldquo;in the most
solemn manner, that Mr.
Otis&rsquo;s Oration against
Writs of Assistance
breathed into this nation
the breath of life.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 336px;">

<span class="caption"><i>James Otis.</i></span>
</div>

<p>In 1765 Mr. Adams
laid before the public,
anonymously, a series of
essays, afterwards collected in a volume in London, under
the title of &ldquo;A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal
Law.&rdquo; The object of this work was to show that our
New England ancestors, in consenting to exile themselves
from their native land, were actuated mainly
by the desire of delivering themselves from the power
of the hierarchy, and from the monarchical and aristocratical
systems of the other continent; and to make
this truth bear with effect on the politics of the times.
Its tone is uncommonly bold and animated for that
period. He calls on the people, not only to defend,
but to study and understand, their rights and privi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>leges;
urges earnestly the necessity of diffusing general
knowledge; invokes the clergy and the bar, the colleges
and academies, and all others who have the ability
and the means to expose the insidious designs of
arbitrary power, to resist its approaches, and to be
persuaded that there is a settled design on foot to
enslave all America. &ldquo;Be it remembered,&rdquo; says the
author, &ldquo;that liberty must, at all hazards, be supported.
We have a right to it, derived from our Maker. But if
we had not, our fathers have earned and bought it for
us, at the expense of their ease, their estates, their
pleasure, and their blood. And liberty cannot be preserved
without a general knowledge among the people,
who have a right, from the frame of their nature, to
knowledge, as their great Creator, who does nothing in
vain, has given them understandings and a desire to
know. But, besides this, they have a right, an indisputable,
unalienable, indefeasible, divine right, to that
most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge, I mean of
the characters and conduct of their rulers. Rulers are
no more than attorneys, agents, and trustees for the
people; and if the cause, the interest and trust, is insidiously
betrayed, or wantonly trifled away, the people
have a right to revoke the authority that they themselves
have deputed, and to constitute abler and better
agents, attorneys, and trustees.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Adams first public office.</div>

<p>The citizens of this town conferred on Mr. Adams his
first political distinction, and clothed him with his first
political trust, by electing him one of their
representatives, in 1770. Before this time
he had become extensively known throughout the Province,
as well by the part he had acted in relation to
public affairs, as by the exercise of his professional
ability. He was among those who took the deepest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
interest in the controversy with England, and, whether
in or out of the legislature, his time and talents were
alike devoted to the cause. In the years 1773 and 1774
he was chosen a Councillor by the members of the General
Court, but rejected by Governor Hutchinson in the
former of those years, and by Governor Gage in the
latter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Election to
the Congress
of Delegates.</div>

<p>The time was now at hand, however, when the affairs
of the Colonies urgently demanded united counsels
throughout the country. An open rupture
with the parent state appeared inevitable, and
it was but the dictate of prudence that those
who were united by a common interest and a common
danger should protect that interest and guard against
that danger by united efforts. A general Congress of
Delegates from all the Colonies having been proposed
and agreed to, the House of Representatives, on the
17th of June, 1774, elected James Bowdoin, Thomas
Cushing, Samuel Adams, John Adams, and Robert
Treat Paine delegates from Massachusetts. This appointment
was made at Salem, where the General Court
had been convened by Governor Gage, in the last hour
of the existence of a House of Representatives under
the Provincial Charter. While engaged in this important
business, the Governor, having been informed of
what was passing, sent his secretary with a message dissolving
the General Court. The secretary, finding the
door locked, directed the messenger to go in and inform
the Speaker that the secretary was at the door with a
message from the Governor. The messenger returned,
and informed the secretary that the orders of the House
were that the doors should be kept fast; whereupon the
secretary soon after read upon the stairs a proclamation
dissolving the General Court. Thus terminated, forever,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
the actual exercise of the political power of England
in or over Massachusetts. The four last-named
delegates accepted their appointments, and took their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>seats in Congress the first day of its meeting, the 5th
of September, 1774, in Philadelphia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The First
Continental
Congress.</div>

<p>The proceedings of the first Congress are well known,
and have been universally admired. It is in vain that
we would look for superior proofs of wisdom,
talent, and patriotism. Lord Chatham said
that, for himself, he must declare that he had
studied and admired the free states of antiquity, the
master states of the world, but that for solidity of reasoning,
force of sagacity, and wisdom of conclusion, no body
of men could stand in preference to this Congress. It
is hardly inferior praise to say that no production of
that great man himself can be pronounced superior to
several of the papers published as the proceedings of
this most able, most firm, most patriotic assembly.
There is, indeed, nothing superior to them in the range
of political disquisition. They not only embrace, illustrate,
and enforce everything which political philosophy,
the love of liberty, and the spirit of free inquiry had
antecedently produced, but they add new and striking
views of their own, and apply the whole, with irresistible
force, in support of the cause which had drawn
them together.</p>

<p>Mr. Adams was a constant attendant on the deliberations
of this body, and bore an active part in its important
measures. He was of the committee to state the
rights of the Colonies, and of that also which reported
the Address to the King.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The author
of the Declaration
of Independence.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas Jefferson</span>, descended from ancestors who
had been settled in Virginia for some generations, was
born near the spot on which he died, in the county of
Albemarle, on the 2d of April (Old Style), 1743. His
youthful studies were pursued in the neighborhood of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>his father&rsquo;s residence until he was removed to the College
of William and Mary, the highest honors of which
he in due time received. Having left the
college with reputation, he applied himself
to the study of the law under the tuition of
George Wythe, one of the highest judicial names of which
that State can boast. At an early age he was elected
a member of the legislature,
in which he had
no sooner appeared
than he distinguished
himself by knowledge,
capacity, and
promptitude.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/illus095.jpg" width="336" height="412" alt="Thomas Jefferson." title="" />
<span class="caption"><i>Thomas Jefferson.</i></span>
</div>

<p>Mr. Jefferson appears
to have been
imbued with an early
love of letters and
science, and to have
cherished a strong
disposition to pursue
these objects. To the
physical sciences, especially,
and to ancient
classic literature,
he is understood to
have had a warm attachment, and never entirely to have
lost sight of them in the midst of the busiest occupations.
But the times were times for action rather than
for contemplation. The country was to be defended
and to be saved, before it could be enjoyed. Philosophic
leisure and literary pursuits, and even the objects
of professional attention, were all necessarily postponed
to the urgent calls of the public service. The exigency<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
of the country made the same demand on Mr. Jefferson
that it made on others who had the ability and the disposition
to serve it; and he obeyed the call.</p>

<p>Entering with all his heart into the cause of liberty,
his ability, patriotism, and power with the pen naturally
drew upon him a large participation in the most important
concerns. Wherever he was, there was found a
soul devoted to the cause, power to defend and maintain
it, and willingness to incur all its hazards. In 1774 he
published a &ldquo;Summary View of the Rights of British
America,&rdquo; a valuable production among those intended
to show the dangers which threatened the liberties of the
country, and to encourage the people in their defence.
In June, 1775, he was elected a member of the Continental
Congress, as successor to Peyton Randolph, who
had resigned his place on account of ill health, and took
his seat in that body on the 21st of the same month.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Declaration
of Independence.</div>

<p>And now, fellow-citizens, without pursuing the biography
of these illustrious men further, for the present,
let us turn our attention to the most prominent
act of their lives, their participation in the
Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>Preparatory to the introduction of that important
measure, a committee, at the head of which was Mr.
Adams, had reported a resolution, which Congress
adopted on the 10th of May, recommending, in substance,
to all the Colonies which had not already established
governments suited to the exigencies of their
affairs, <i>to adopt such government as would, in the opinion
of the representatives of the people, best conduce to the happiness
and safety of their constituents in particular, and
America in general</i>.</p>

<p>This significant vote was soon followed by the direct
proposition which Richard Henry Lee had the honor to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
submit to Congress, by resolution, on the seventh day of
June. The published journal does not expressly state
it, but there is no doubt, I suppose, that this resolution
was in the same words, when originally submitted by
Mr. Lee, as when finally passed. Having been discussed
on Saturday, the 8th, and Monday, the 10th of June,
this resolution was on the last-mentioned day postponed
for further consideration to the first day of July; and
at the same time it was voted, that a committee be appointed
to prepare a Declaration to the effect of the
resolution. This committee was elected by ballot, on
the following day, and consisted of Thomas Jefferson,
John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and
Robert R. Livingston.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 80%;">

<span class="caption">THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE</span>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">The original
draft.</div>

<p>It is usual, when committees are elected by ballot,
that their members should be arranged in order, according
to the number of votes which each has
received. Mr. Jefferson, therefore, had
received the highest, and Mr. Adams the next highest
number of votes. The difference is said to have been but
of a single vote. Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Adams, standing
thus at the head of the committee, were requested by
the other members to act as a subcommittee to prepare
the draft; and Mr. Jefferson drew up the paper. The
original draft, as brought by him from his study, and
submitted to the other members of the committee, with
interlineations in the handwriting of Dr. Franklin, and
others in that of Mr. Adams, was in Mr. Jefferson&rsquo;s
possession at the time of his death. The merit of this
paper is Mr. Jefferson&rsquo;s. Some changes were made in
it at the suggestion of other members of the committee,
and others by Congress while it was under discussion.
But none of them altered the tone, the frame, the arrangement,
or the general character of the instrument.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> As
a composition, the Declaration is Mr. Jefferson&rsquo;s.
It is the production of his mind, and the high honor of
it belongs to him, clearly and absolutely.</p>

<p>It has sometimes been said, as if it were a derogation
from the merits of this paper, that it contains nothing
new; that it only states grounds of proceeding, and
presses topics of argument, which had often been stated
and pressed before. But it was not the object of the
Declaration to produce anything new. It was not to
invent reasons for independence, but to state those which
governed the Congress. For great and sufficient causes,
it was proposed to declare independence; and the proper
business of the paper to be drawn was to set forth
those causes, and justify the authors of the measure, in
any event of fortune, to the country and to posterity.
The cause of American independence, moreover, was
now to be presented to the world in such manner, if it
might so be, as to engage its sympathy, to command its
respect, to attract its admiration; and in an assembly of
most able and distinguished men, Thomas Jefferson had
the high honor of being the selected advocate of this
cause. To say that he performed his great work well,
would be doing him injustice. To say that he did excellently
well, admirably well, would be inadequate and
halting praise. Let us rather say, that he so discharged
the duty assigned him, that all Americans may well rejoice
that the work of drawing the title-deed of their
liberties devolved upon him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The debate
on the
Declaration.</div>

<p>The Declaration having been reported to Congress
by the committee, the resolution itself was
taken up and debated on the first day of July,
and again on the 2d, on which last day it
was agreed to and adopted, in these words:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Resolved</i>, That these united Colonies are, and of
right ought to be, free and independent States; that
they are absolved from all allegiance to the British
crown, and that all political connection between them
and the state of Great Britain is, and ought to be,
totally dissolved.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 4, 1776.</div>

<p>Having thus passed the main resolution, Congress
proceeded to consider the reported draft of the Declaration.
It was discussed on the second and third and
fourth days of the month in committee of the whole;
and on the last of those days, being reported from that
committee, it received the final approbation and sanction
of Congress. It was ordered, at the same time, that
copies be sent to the several States, and that it be proclaimed
at the head of the army. The Declaration thus
published did not bear the names of the members, for as
yet it had not been signed by them. It was authenticated,
like other papers of the Congress, by the signatures
of the President and Secretary. On the 19th of
July, as appears by the secret journal, Congress &ldquo;<i>Resolved</i>,
That the Declaration, passed on the fourth, be
fairly engrossed on parchment, with the title and style
of &lsquo;The unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United
States of America;&rsquo; and that the same, when engrossed,
be signed by every member of Congress.&rdquo; And on the
second day of August following, &ldquo;the Declaration, being
engrossed and compared at the table, was signed by the
members.&rdquo; So that it happens, fellow-citizens, that we
pay these honors to their memory on the anniversary
of that day (2d of August) on which these great men
actually signed their names to the Declaration. The
Declaration was thus made, that is, it passed and was
adopted as an act of Congress, on the 4th of July; it
was then signed, and certified by the President and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>Secretary like other acts. The Fourth of July, therefore,
is the anniversary of the Declaration. But the
signatures of the members present were made
to it, being then engrossed on parchment, on
the second day of August. Absent members afterwards
signed, as they came in; and indeed it bears the names
of some who were not chosen members of Congress
until after the 4th of July. The interest belonging to
the subject will be sufficient, I hope, to justify these
details.</p>

<p>The Congress of the Revolution, fellow-citizens, sat
with closed doors, and no report of its debates was ever
made. The discussion, therefore, which accompanied
this great measure, has never been preserved, except in
memory and by tradition. But it is, I believe, doing no
injustice to others to say, that the general opinion was,
and uniformly has been, that in debate, on the side of
independence, John Adams had no equal. The great
author of the Declaration himself has expressed that
opinion uniformly and strongly. &ldquo;John Adams,&rdquo;
said he, in the hearing of him who has now the
honor to address you, &ldquo;John Adams was our colossus
on the floor. Not graceful, not elegant, not always
fluent, in his public addresses, he yet came out with a
power, both of thought and of expression, which moved
us from our seats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the part which he was here to perform, Mr.
Adams doubtless was eminently fitted. He possessed a
bold spirit, which disregarded danger, and a sanguine
reliance on the goodness of the cause, and the virtues of
the people, which led him to overlook all obstacles. His
character, too, had been formed in troubled times. He
had been rocked in the early storms of the controversy,
and had acquired a decision and a hardihood propor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>tioned
to the severity of the discipline which he had
undergone.</p>

<p>He not only loved the American cause devoutly, but
had studied and understood it. It was all familiar to
him. He had tried his powers on the questions which it
involved, often and in various ways; and had brought
to their consideration whatever of argument or illustration
the history of his own country, the history of England,
or the stores of ancient or of legal learning could
furnish. Every grievance enumerated in the long catalogue
of the Declaration had been the subject of his
discussion, and the object of his remonstrance and reprobation.
From 1760 the Colonies, the rights of the
Colonies, the liberties of the Colonies, and the wrongs
inflicted on the Colonies, had engaged his constant attention;
and it has surprised those who have had the
opportunity of witnessing it, with what full remembrance
and with what prompt recollection he could refer,
in his extreme old age, to every act of Parliament affecting
the Colonies, distinguishing and stating their respective
titles, sections, and provisions; and to all the
colonial memorials, remonstrances, and petitions, with
whatever else belonged to the intimate and exact history
of the times from that year to 1775. It was, in his own
judgment, between these years that the American people
came to a full understanding and thorough knowledge
of their rights, and to a fixed resolution of maintaining
them; and bearing himself an active part in all important
transactions,&mdash;the controversy with England being
then in effect the business of his life,&mdash;facts, dates, and
particulars made an impression which was never effaced.
He was prepared, therefore, by education and discipline,
as well as by natural talent and natural temperament,
for the part which he was now to act.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The nature of true eloquence.</div>

<p>The eloquence of Mr. Adams resembled his general
character, and formed, indeed, a part of it. It was bold,
manly, and energetic; and such the crisis required.
When public bodies are to be addressed
on momentous occasions, when great
interests are at stake, and strong passions excited, nothing
is valuable in speech farther than as it is connected
with high intellectual and moral endowments. Clearness,
force, and earnestness are the qualities which produce
conviction. True eloquence, indeed, does not
consist in speech. It cannot be brought from far.
Labor and learning may toil for it, but they will toil in
vain. Words and phrases may be marshalled in every
way, but they cannot compass it. It must exist in the
man, in the subject, and in the occasion. Affected passion,
intense expression, the pomp of declamation, all
may aspire to it; they cannot reach it. It comes, if it
come at all, like the outbreaking of a fountain from the
earth, or the bursting forth of volcanic fires, with spontaneous,
original, native force. The graces taught in
the schools, the costly ornaments and studied contrivances
of speech, shock and disgust men, when their own
lives, and the fate of their wives, their children, and
their country, hang on the decision of the hour. Then
words have lost their power, rhetoric is vain, and all
elaborate oratory contemptible. Even genius itself
then feels rebuked and subdued, as in the presence of
higher qualities. Then patriotism is eloquent; then
self-devotion is eloquent. The clear conception, outrunning
the deductions of logic, the high purpose, the
firm resolve, the dauntless spirit, speaking on the
tongue, beaming from the eye, informing every feature,
and urging the whole man onward, right onward to his
object,&mdash;this, this is eloquence; or rather, it is some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>thing
greater and higher than all eloquence,&mdash;it is
action, noble, sublime, godlike action.</p>

<p>In July, 1776, the controversy had passed the stage
of argument. An appeal had been made to force, and
opposing armies were in the field. Congress, then, was
to decide whether the tie which had so long bound us
to the parent state was to be severed at once, and severed
forever. All the Colonies had signified their resolution
to abide by this decision, and the people looked
for it with the most intense anxiety. And surely,
fellow-citizens, never, never were men called to a more
important political deliberation. If we contemplate it
from the point where they then stood, no question could
be more full of interest; if we look at it now, and judge
of its importance by its effects, it appears of still greater
magnitude.</p>

<p>Let us, then, bring before us the assembly which was
about to decide a question thus big with the fate of
empire. Let us open their doors and look in upon their
deliberations. Let us survey the anxious and careworn
countenances, let us hear the firm-toned voices, of this
band of patriots.</p>

<p>Hancock presides over the solemn sitting; and one
of those not yet prepared to pronounce for absolute independence
is on the floor, and is urging his reasons for
dissenting from the Declaration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An imaginary speech in opposition to the Declaration.</div>

<p>&ldquo;Let us pause! This step, once taken, cannot be retraced.
This resolution, once passed, will cut off all
hope of reconciliation. If success attend the
arms of England, we shall then be no longer
Colonies with charters and with privileges;
these will all be forfeited by this act; and we
shall be in the condition of other conquered people, at
the mercy of the conquerors. For ourselves, we may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
ready to run the hazard; but are we ready to carry the
country to that length? Is success so probable as to
justify it? Where is the military, where the naval
power, by which we are to resist the whole strength of
the arm of England,&mdash;for she will exert that strength
to the utmost? Can we rely on the constancy and perseverance
of the people?
or will they not
act as the people of
other countries have
acted, and, wearied
with a long war, submit,
in the end, to a
worse oppression?
While we stand on
our old ground, and
insist on redress of
grievances, we know
we are right, and are
not answerable for
consequences. Nothing,
then, can be imputed
to us. But if
we now change our
object, carry our pretensions
farther, and set up for absolute independence,
we shall lose the sympathy of mankind. We shall no
longer be defending what we possess, but struggling for
something which we never did possess, and which we
have solemnly and uniformly disclaimed all intention
of pursuing, from the very outset of the troubles.
Abandoning thus our old ground of resistance only to
arbitrary acts of oppression, the nations will believe the
whole to have been mere pretence, and they will look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
on us, not as injured, but as ambitious subjects. I
shudder before this responsibility. It will be on us, if,
relinquishing the ground on which we have stood so
long, and stood so safely, we now proclaim independence,
and carry on the war for that object, while these
cities burn, these pleasant fields whiten and bleach with
the bones of their owners, and these streams run blood.
It will be upon us, it will be upon us, if, failing to
maintain this unseasonable and ill-judged declaration, a
sterner despotism, maintained by military power, shall
be established over our posterity, when we ourselves,
given up by an exhausted, a harassed, a misled people,
shall have expiated our rashness and atoned for our presumption
on the scaffold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was for Mr. Adams to reply to arguments like
these. We know his opinions, and we know his
character. He would commence with his accustomed
directness and earnestness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Supposed speech of John Adams in favor of the Declaration.</div>

<p>&ldquo;Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish, I give
my hand and my heart to this vote. It is true, indeed,
that in the beginning we aimed not at independence.
But there&rsquo;s a divinity which
shapes our ends. The injustice of England
has driven us to arms; and, blinded to her
own interest for our good, she has obstinately
persisted, till independence is now within our grasp.
We have but to reach forth to it, and it is ours. Why,
then, should we defer the Declaration? Is any man
so weak as now to hope for a reconciliation with England
which shall leave either safety to the country and its
liberties, or safety to his own life and his own honor?
Are not you, Sir, who sit in that chair,&mdash;is not he, our
venerable colleague near you,&mdash;are you not both already
the proscribed and predestined objects of punishment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
and of vengeance? Cut off from all hope of royal
clemency, what are you, what can you be, while the
power of England remains, but outlaws? If we postpone
independence, do we mean to carry on, or to give
up, the war? Do we mean to submit to the measures of
Parliament, Boston Port Bill<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and all? Do we mean to
submit, and consent that we ourselves shall be ground
to powder, and our country and its rights trodden down
in the dust? I know we do not mean to submit. We
never shall submit. Do we intend to violate that most
solemn obligation ever entered into by men, that plighting,
before God, of our sacred honor to Washington,
when, putting him forth to incur the dangers of war,
as well as the political hazards of the times, we promised
to adhere to him, in every extremity, with our fortunes
and our lives? I know there is not a man here who
would not rather see a general conflagration sweep over
the land, or an earthquake sink it, than one jot or tittle
of that plighted faith fall to the ground. For myself,
having, twelve months ago, in this place, moved you
that George Washington be appointed commander of
the forces raised, or to be raised, for defence of American
liberty, may my right hand forget her cunning, and
my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I hesitate
or waver in the support I give him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The war, then, must go on. We must fight it
through. And if the war must go on, why put off
longer the Declaration of Independence? That measure
will strengthen us. It will give us character abroad.
The nations will then treat with us, which they never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
can do while we acknowledge ourselves subjects, in
arms against our sovereign. Nay, I maintain that
England herself will sooner treat for peace with us on
the footing of independence, than consent, by repealing
her acts, to acknowledge that her whole conduct towards
us has been a course of injustice and oppression. Her
pride will be less wounded by submitting to that course
of things which now predestinates our independence,
than by yielding the points in controversy to her rebellious
subjects. The former she would regard as the
result of fortune; the latter she would feel as her own
deep disgrace. Why then, why then, Sir, do we not as
soon as possible change this from a civil to a national
war? And since we must fight it through, why not
put ourselves in a state to enjoy all the benefits of victory,
if we gain the victory?</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we fail, it can be no worse for us. But we shall
not fail. The cause will raise up armies; the cause
will create navies. The people, the people, if we are
true to them, will carry us, and will carry themselves,
gloriously through this struggle. I care not how fickle
other people have been found. I know the people of
these Colonies, and I know that resistance to British
aggression is deep and settled in their hearts and cannot
be eradicated. Every Colony, indeed, has expressed its
willingness to follow, if we but take the lead. Sir,
the Declaration will inspire the people with increased
courage. Instead of a long and bloody war for the
restoration of privileges, for redress of grievances, for
chartered immunities, held under a British king, set
before them the glorious object of entire independence
and it will breathe into them anew the breath of life.
Read this Declaration at the head of the army; every
sword will be drawn from its scabbard, and the solemn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
vow uttered, to maintain it, or to perish on the bed of
honor. Publish it from the pulpit; religion will approve
it, and the love of religious liberty will cling round it,
resolved to stand with it or fall with it. Send it to the
public halls; proclaim it there; let them hear it who
heard the first roar of the enemy&rsquo;s cannon; let them see
it who saw their brothers and their sons fall on the field
of Bunker Hill, and in the streets of Lexington and
Concord, and the very walls will cry out in its support.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, I know the uncertainty of human affairs, but I
see, I see clearly, through this day&rsquo;s business. You and
I, indeed, may rue it. We may not live to the time
when this Declaration shall be made good. We may
die; die colonists; die slaves; die, it may be, ignominiously
and on the scaffold. Be it so. Be it so. If
it be the pleasure of Heaven that my country shall
require the poor offering of my life, the victim shall
be ready, at the appointed hour of sacrifice, come when
that hour may. But while I do live, let me have a
country, or at least the hope of a country, and that a
free country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But whatever may be our fate, be assured, be assured
that this Declaration will stand. It may cost treasure,
and it may cost blood; but it will stand, and it will
richly compensate for both. Through the thick gloom
of the present, I see the brightness of the future, as
the sun in heaven. We shall make this a glorious, an
immortal day. When we are in our graves, our children
will honor it. They will celebrate it with thanksgiving,
with festivity, with bonfires, and illuminations. On its
annual return they will shed tears, copious, gushing
tears, not of subjection and slavery, not of agony and
distress, but of exultation, of gratitude, and of joy.
Sir, before God, I believe the hour is come. My judg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>ment
approves this measure, and my whole heart is in
it. All that I have, and all that I am, and all that I
hope, in this life, I am now ready here to stake upon
it; and I leave off as I begun, that live or die, survive
or perish, I am for the Declaration. It is my living
sentiment, and by the blessing of God it shall be my
dying sentiment, Independence <i>now</i>, and Independence
forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so that day shall be honored, illustrious prophet
and patriot! so that day shall be honored, and as often
as it returns, thy renown shall come along with it, and
the glory of thy life, like the day of thy death, shall not
fail from the remembrance of men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tributes to John Hancock, Samuel Adams, and Robert Treat Paine.</div>

<p>It would be unjust, fellow-citizens, on this occasion,
while we express our veneration for him who is the
immediate subject of these remarks, were we
to omit a most respectful, affectionate, and
grateful mention of those other great men,
his colleagues, who stood with him, and with
the same spirit, the same devotion, took part
in the interesting transaction. Hancock, the proscribed
Hancock, exiled from his home by a military governor,
cut off by proclamation from the mercy of the crown,&mdash;Heaven
reserved for him the distinguished honor of
putting this great question to the vote, and of writing
his own name first, and most conspicuously, on that
parchment which spoke defiance to the power of the
crown of England. There, too, is the name of that other
proscribed patriot, Samuel Adams, a man who hungered
and thirsted for the independence of his country, who
thought the Declaration halted and lingered, being himself
not only ready, but eager for it, long before it was
proposed; a man of the deepest sagacity, the clearest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
foresight, and the profoundest judgment in men. And
there is Gerry, himself among the earliest and the foremost
of the patriots, found when the battle of Lexington
summoned them to common counsels, by the
side of Warren; a man
who lived to serve his
country at home and
abroad, and to die in
the second place in the
government.  There,
too, is the inflexible, the
upright, the Spartan
character, Robert Treat
Paine.  He also lived
to serve his country
through the struggle,
and then withdrew from
her councils, only that
he might give his labors
and his life to his native
State, in another relation.
These names, fellow-citizens,
are the treasures of the Commonwealth;
and they are treasures which grow brighter by time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is now necessary to resume the narrative, and to
finish with great brevity the notice of the lives of
those whose virtues and services we have met to
commemorate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Adams appointed Minister to France.</div>

<p>Mr. Adams remained in Congress from its first meeting
till November, 1777, when he was appointed Minister
to France. He proceeded on that service in the
February following, embarking in the frigate &ldquo;Boston,&rdquo;
from the shore of his native town, at the foot of Mount
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>Wollaston. The year following, he was appointed commissioner
to treat of peace with England. Returning to
the United States, he was a delegate from
Braintree in the Convention for framing the
Constitution of this Commonwealth, in 1780.
At the latter end of the same year, he again went abroad
in the diplomatic service of the country, and was
employed at various courts, and occupied with various
negotiations, until 1788. The particulars of these interesting
and important services this occasion does not
allow time to relate. In 1782 he concluded our first
treaty with Holland. His negotiations with that republic,
his efforts to persuade the States-General<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> to recognize
our independence, his incessant and indefatigable
exertions to represent the American cause favorably on
the Continent, and to counteract the designs of its
enemies, open and secret, and his successful undertaking
to obtain loans on the credit of a nation yet new and
unknown, are among his most arduous, most useful, most
honorable services. It was his fortune to bear a part
in the negotiation for peace with England, and in something
more than six years from the Declaration which
he had so strenuously supported, he had the satisfaction
of seeing the minister plenipotentiary of the crown subscribe
his name to the instrument which declared that
his &ldquo;Britannic Majesty acknowledged the United States
to be free, sovereign, and independent.&rdquo; In these important
transactions, Mr. Adams&rsquo;s conduct received the
marked approbation of Congress and of the country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vice-President, 1789-1797; President, 1797-1801.</div>

<p>Returning to the United States in 1788, he found the
new government about going into operation, and was
himself elected the first Vice-President,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> a situation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>which he filled with reputation for eight years, at the
expiration of which he was raised to the Presidential
chair, as immediate successor to the immortal
Washington. In this high station he
was succeeded by Mr. Jefferson, after a memorable
controversy between their respective
friends, in 1801; and from that period his manner of
life has been known to all who hear me. He has lived,
for five-and-twenty years, with every enjoyment that
could render old age happy. Not inattentive to the
occurrences of the times, political cares have yet not
materially, or for any long time, disturbed his repose.
In 1820 he acted as Elector of President and Vice-President,
and in the same year we saw him, then at the age
of eighty-five, a member of the Convention of this Commonwealth
called to revise the Constitution. Forty
years before, he had been one of those who formed that
Constitution; and he had now the pleasure of witnessing
that there was little which the people desired to change.
Possessing all his faculties to the end of his long life,
with an unabated love of reading and contemplation, in
the centre of interesting circles of friendship and affection,
he was blessed in his retirement with whatever of
repose and felicity the condition of man allows. He
had, also, other enjoyments. He saw around him that
prosperity and general happiness which had been the
object of his public cares and labors. No man ever
beheld more clearly, and for a longer time, the great and
beneficial effects of the services rendered by himself to
his country. That liberty which he so early defended,
that independence of which he was so able an advocate
and supporter, he saw, we trust, firmly and securely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
established. The population of the country thickened
around him faster, and extended wider, than his own
sanguine predictions had anticipated; and the wealth,
respectability, and power of the nation sprang up to a
magnitude which it is quite impossible he could have
expected to witness in his day. He lived also to behold
those principles of civil freedom which had been developed,
established, and practically applied in America,
attract attention, command respect, and awaken imitation,
in other regions of the globe; and well might, and
well did, he exclaim, &ldquo;Where will the consequences of
the American Revolution end?&rdquo;</p>

<p>If anything yet remain to fill this cup of happiness,
let it be added, that he lived to see a great and intelligent
people bestow the highest honor in their gift where
he had bestowed his own kindest parental affections and
lodged his fondest hopes.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Thus honored in life, thus
happy at death, he saw the jubilee,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and he died; and
with the last prayers which trembled on his lips was the
fervent supplication for his country, &ldquo;Independence forever!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Minister to France.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Is made Secretary of State by Washington.</div>

<p>Mr. Jefferson, having been occupied in the years 1778
and 1779 in the important service of revising the laws
of Virginia, was elected Governor of that
State, as successor to Patrick Henry, and
held the situation when the State was invaded
by the British arms. In 1781 he published his &ldquo;Notes
on Virginia,&rdquo; a work which attracted attention in Europe
as well as America, dispelled many misconceptions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>respecting this continent, and gave its author a place
among men distinguished for science. In November,
1783, he again took his seat in the Continental Congress,
but in the May following was appointed Minister
Plenipotentiary, to act
abroad, in the negotiation
of commercial treaties,
with Dr. Franklin
and Mr. Adams. He
proceeded to France, in
execution of this mission,
embarking at Boston;
and that was the
only occasion on which
he ever visited this place.
In 1785 he was appointed
Minister to France, the
duties of which situation
he continued to perform
until October, 1789,
when he obtained leave to retire, just on the eve of
that tremendous revolution which has so much agitated
the world in our times.
Mr. Jefferson&rsquo;s discharge
of his diplomatic duties was marked
by great ability, diligence, and patriotism; and while
he resided at Paris, in one of the most interesting
periods, his character for intelligence, his love of knowledge
and of the society of learned men, distinguished
him in the highest circles of the French capital. No
court in Europe had at that time in Paris a representative
commanding or enjoying higher regard, for political
knowledge or for general attainments, than the minister
of this then infant republic. Immediately on his return
to his native country, at the organization of the
gov<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>ernment under the present Constitution, his talents and
experience recommended him to President Washington
for the first office in his gift. He was placed
at the head of the Department of State. In
this situation, also, he manifested conspicuous
ability. His correspondence with the ministers of other
powers residing here, and his instructions to our own
diplomatic agents
abroad, are among
our ablest state papers.
A thorough
knowledge of the laws
and usages of nations,
perfect acquaintance
with the immediate
subject before him,
great felicity, and
still greater facility,
in writing, show
themselves in whatever
effort his official
situation called on
him to make. It is
believed by competent
judges, that the diplomatic
intercourse
of the government of the United States, from the first
meeting of the Continental Congress in 1774 to the
present time, taken together, would not suffer, in respect
to the talent with which it has been conducted,
by comparison with anything which other and older
governments can produce; and to the attainment of
this respectability and distinction Mr. Jefferson has
contributed his full part.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Vice-President, 1797-1801; President, 1801-1809.</div>

<p>On the retirement of General Washington from the
Presidency, and the election of Mr. Adams to that office
in 1797, he was chosen Vice-President.
While presiding in this capacity over the
deliberations of the Senate, he compiled and
published a Manual of Parliamentary Practice,
a work of more labor and more merit than is indicated
by its size. It is now received as the general
standard by which proceedings are regulated, not only
in both Houses of Congress, but in most of the other
legislative bodies in the country.  In 1801 he was
elected President, in opposition to Mr. Adams, and
re-elected in 1805, by a vote approaching towards
unanimity.</p>

<p>From the time of his final retirement from public life,
in 1809, Mr. Jefferson lived as became a wise man.
Surrounded by affectionate friends, his ardor in the
pursuit of knowledge undiminished, with uncommon
health and unbroken spirits, he was able to enjoy largely
the rational pleasures of life, and to partake in that
public prosperity which he had so much contributed
to produce. His kindness and hospitality, the charm
of his conversation, the ease of his manners, the extent
of his acquirements, and, especially, the full store
of Revolutionary incidents which he had treasured in
his memory, and which he knew when and how to
dispense, rendered his abode in a high degree attractive
to his admiring countrymen, while his high public
and scientific character drew towards him every
intelligent and educated traveller from abroad. Both
Mr. Adams and Mr. Jefferson had the pleasure of knowing
that the respect which they so largely received was
not paid to their official stations. They were not men
made great by office; but great men, on whom the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
country for its own benefit had conferred office. There
was that in them which office did not give, and which
the relinquishment of office did not, and could not, take
away. In their retirement, in the midst of their fellow-citizens,
themselves private citizens, they enjoyed as
high regard and esteem as when filling the most important
places of public trust.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Establishes the University of Virginia.</div>

<p>There remained to Mr. Jefferson yet one other work
of patriotism and beneficence, the establishment of a
university in his native State. To this object

<p>Thus useful, and thus respected, passed the old age
of Thomas Jefferson. But time was on its ever-ceaseless
wing, and was now bringing the last hour of this
illustrious man. He saw its approach with undisturbed
serenity. He counted the moments as they passed, and
beheld that his last sands were falling. That day, too,
was at hand which he had helped to make immortal.
One wish, one hope, if it were not presumptuous, beat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
in his fainting breast. Could it be so, might it please
God, he would desire once more to see the sun, once
more to look abroad on the scene around him, on the
great day of liberty. Heaven, in its mercy, fulfilled that
prayer. He saw that sun; he enjoyed its sacred light;
he thanked God for this mercy, and bowed his aged
head to the grave. &ldquo;Felix, non vit&aelig; tantum claritate,
sed etiam opportunitate mortis.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The last public labor of Mr. Jefferson naturally suggests
the expression of the high praise which is due,
both to him and to Mr. Adams, for their uniform and
zealous attachment to learning, and to the cause of
general knowledge. Of the advantages of learning, indeed,
and of literary accomplishments, their own characters
were striking recommendations and illustrations.
They were scholars, ripe and good scholars; widely acquainted
with ancient as well as modern literature, and
not altogether uninstructed in the deeper sciences. Their
acquirements, doubtless, were different, and so were the
particular objects of their literary pursuits; as their
tastes and characters, in these respects, differed like
those of other men. Being, also, men of busy lives, with
great objects requiring action constantly before them,
their attainments in letters did not become showy or
obtrusive. Yet I would hazard the opinion that if we
could now ascertain all the causes which gave them
eminence and distinction in the midst of the great men
with whom they acted, we should find not among the
least their early acquisitions in literature, the resources
which it furnished, the promptitude and facility which
it communicated, and the wide field it opened for analogy
and illustration; giving them thus, on every sub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>ject,
a larger view and a broader range, as well for
discussion as for the government of their own conduct.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fellow-citizens, I will detain you no longer by this
faint and feeble tribute to the memory of the illustrious
dead. Even in other hands adequate justice could not
be done to them, within the limits of this occasion.
Their highest, their best praise is your deep conviction
of their merits, your affectionate gratitude for their
labors and their services. It is not my voice, it is this
cessation of ordinary pursuits, this arresting of all attention,
these solemn ceremonies, and this crowded house,
which speak their eulogy. Their fame, indeed, is safe.
That is now treasured up beyond the reach of accident.
Although no sculptured marble should rise to their
memory, nor engraved stone bear record of their deeds,
yet will their remembrance be as lasting as the land
they honored. Marble columns may, indeed, moulder
into dust; time may erase all impress from the crumbling
stone; but their fame remains; for with American
Liberty it rose, and with American Liberty only can it
perish. It was the last swelling peal of yonder choir:
&ldquo;Their bodies are buried in peace, but their name liveth
evermore.&rdquo; I catch that solemn song, I echo that lofty
strain of funeral triumph, &ldquo;Their name liveth evermore.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">America&rsquo;s
debt to the
fathers.</div>

<p>And now, fellow-citizens, let us not retire from this
occasion without a deep and solemn conviction of the
duties which have devolved upon us. This
lovely land, this glorious liberty, these benign
institutions, the dear purchase of our fathers,
are ours; ours to enjoy, ours to preserve, ours to transmit.
Generations past and generations to come hold us
responsible for this sacred trust. Our fathers, from
behind, admonish us, with their anxious paternal voices;
posterity calls out to us, from the bosom of the future;
the world turns hither its solicitous eyes; all, all conjure
us to act wisely, and faithfully, in the relation
which we sustain. We can never, indeed, pay the debt
which is upon us; but by virtue, by morality, by religion,
by the cultivation of every good principle and
every good habit, we may hope to enjoy the blessing,
through our day, and to leave it unimpaired to our
children. Let us feel deeply how much of what we are
and of what we possess we owe to this liberty, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
to these institutions of government. Nature has, indeed,
given us a soil which yields bounteously to the
hand of industry; the mighty and fruitful ocean is
before us; and the skies over our heads shed health and
vigor. But what are lands, and seas, and skies to civilized
man, without society, without knowledge, without
morals, without religious culture; and how can these be
enjoyed, in all their extent and all their excellence, but
under the protection of wise institutions and a free
government? Fellow-citizens, there is not one of us,
there is not one of us here present, who does not, at
this moment, and at every moment, experience, in his
own condition, and in the condition of those most near
and dear to him, the influence and the benefits of this
liberty and these institutions. Let us then acknowledge
the blessing, let us feel it deeply and powerfully, let us
cherish a strong affection for it, and resolve to maintain
and perpetuate it. The blood of our fathers, let it not
have been shed in vain; the great hope of posterity, let
it not be blasted.</p>

<p>The striking attitude, too, in which we stand to the
world around us, a topic to which, I fear, I advert too
often and dwell on too long, cannot be altogether
omitted here. Neither individuals nor nations can perform
their part well until they understand and feel its
importance, and comprehend and justly appreciate all
the duties belonging to it. It is not to inflate national
vanity, nor to swell a light and empty feeling of self-importance,
but it is that we may judge justly of our
situation, and of our own duties, that I earnestly urge
upon you this consideration of our position and our
character among the nations of the earth. It cannot be
denied, but by those who would dispute against the sun,
that with America, and in America, a new era com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>mences
in human affairs. This era is distinguished by
free representative governments, by entire religious
liberty, by improved systems of national intercourse, by
a newly awakened and an unconquerable spirit of free
inquiry, and by a diffusion of knowledge through the
community, such as has been before altogether unknown
and unheard of. America, America, our country,
fellow-citizens, our own dear and native land, is inseparably
connected, fast bound up, in fortune and by fate,
with these great interests. If they fall, we fall with
them; if they stand, it will be because we have maintained
them. Let us contemplate, then, this connection,
which binds the prosperity of others to our own; and
let us manfully discharge all the duties which it imposes.
If we cherish the virtues and the principles
of our fathers, Heaven will assist us to carry on the
work of human liberty and human happiness. Auspicious
omens cheer us. Great examples are before us.
Our own firmament now shines brightly upon our path.
Washington is in the clear, upper sky. These other
stars have now joined the American constellation; they
circle round their centre, and the heavens beam with
new light. Beneath this illumination let us walk the
course of life, and at its close devoutly commend our
beloved country, the common parent of us all, to the
Divine Benignity.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">FROM AN ARGUMENT ON THE TRIAL OF JOHN FRANCIS
KNAPP, AT SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS, AUG. 3, 1830</p>


<p>Gentlemen, it is a most extraordinary case. In some
respects, it has hardly a precedent anywhere; certainly
none in our New England history. This bloody drama
exhibited no suddenly excited, ungovernable rage.
The actors in it were not surprised by any lion-like
temptation springing upon their virtue, and overcoming
it, before resistance could begin. Nor did they do
the deed to glut savage vengeance, or satiate
long-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>settled and deadly hate. It was a cool, calculating,
money-making murder. It was all &ldquo;hire and salary,
not revenge.&rdquo; It was the weighing of money against
life; the counting out of so many pieces of silver
against so many ounces of blood.</p>

<p>An aged man, without an enemy in the world, in his
own house, and in his own bed, is made the victim of
a butcherly murder, for mere pay. Truly, here is a
new lesson for painters and poets. Whoever shall
hereafter draw the portrait of murder, if he will show
it as it has been exhibited, where such example was
last to have been looked for, in the very bosom of our
New England society, let him not give it the grim
visage of Moloch, the brow knitted by revenge, the
face black with settled hate, and the bloodshot eye
emitting livid fires of malice. Let him draw, rather,
a decorous, smooth-faced, bloodless demon; a picture
in repose, rather than in action; not so much an
example of human nature in its depravity, and in its
paroxysms of crime, as an infernal being, a fiend, in
the ordinary display and development of his character.</p>

<p>The deed was executed with a degree of self-possession
and steadiness equal to the wickedness with which
it was planned. The circumstances now clearly in
evidence spread out the whole scene before us. Deep
sleep had fallen on the destined victim, and on all
beneath his roof. A healthful old man, to whom sleep
was sweet, the first sound slumbers of the night held
him in their soft but strong embrace. The assassin
enters, through the window already prepared, into an
unoccupied apartment. With noiseless foot he paces
the lonely hall, half lighted by the moon; he winds up
the ascent of the stairs, and reaches the door of the
chamber. Of this, he moves the lock, by soft and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
continued pressure, till it turns on its hinges without
noise; and he enters, and beholds his victim before
him. The room is uncommonly open to the admission
of light. The face of the innocent sleeper is turned
from the murderer, and the beams of the moon, resting
on the gray locks of his aged temple, show him where
to strike. The fatal blow is given! and the victim
passes, without a struggle or a motion, from the repose
of sleep to the repose of death! It is the assassin&rsquo;s
purpose to make sure work; and he plies the dagger,
though it is obvious that life has been destroyed by the
blow of the bludgeon. He even raises the aged arm,
that he may not fail in his aim at the heart, and
replaces it again over the wounds of the poniard! To
finish the picture, he explores the wrist for the pulse!
He feels for it, and ascertains that it beats no longer!
It is accomplished. The deed is done. He retreats,
retraces his steps to the window, passes out through it
as he came in, and escapes. He has done the murder.
No eye has seen him, no ear has heard him. The
secret is his own, and it is safe!</p>

<div class="sidenote">&ldquo;Murder
will out.&rdquo;</div>

<p>Ah! gentlemen, that was a dreadful mistake. Such
a secret can be safe nowhere. The whole creation of
God has neither nook nor corner where the
guilty can bestow it, and say it is safe. Not
to speak of that eye which pierces through all disguises,
and beholds everything as in the splendor of noon, such
secrets of guilt are never safe from detection, even by
men. True it is, generally speaking, that &ldquo;murder will
out.&rdquo; True it is, that Providence hath so ordained,
and doth so govern things, that those who break the
great law of Heaven by shedding man&rsquo;s blood seldom
succeed in avoiding discovery. Especially, in a case
exciting so much attention as this, discovery must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
come, and will come, sooner or later. A thousand
eyes turn at once to explore every man, every thing,
every circumstance, connected with the time and place;
a thousand ears catch every whisper; a thousand excited
minds intensely dwell on the scene, shedding all their
light, and ready to kindle the slightest circumstance
into a blaze of discovery. Meantime the guilty soul
cannot keep its own secret. It is false to itself; or,
rather, it feels an irresistible impulse of conscience to
be true to itself. It labors under its guilty possession,
and knows not what to do with it. The human heart
was not made for the residence of such an inhabitant.
It finds itself preyed on by a torment, which it dares
not acknowledge to God or man. A vulture is devouring
it, and it can ask no sympathy or assistance, either
from heaven or earth. The secret which the murderer
possesses soon comes to possess him; and, like the evil
spirits of which we read, it overcomes him, and leads
him whithersoever it will. He feels it beating at his
heart, rising to his throat, and demanding disclosure.
He thinks the whole world sees it in his face, reads it
in his eyes, and almost hears its workings in the very
silence of his thoughts. It has become his master. It
betrays his discretion, it breaks down his courage, it
conquers his prudence. When suspicions from without
begin to embarrass him, and the net of circumstance
to entangle him, the fatal secret struggles with still
greater violence to burst forth. It must be confessed,
it will be confessed; there is no refuge from confession
but suicide, and suicide is confession.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;When the mariner has been tossed
for many days in thick weather, and on an unknown
sea, he naturally avails himself of the first pause in
the storm, the earliest glance of the sun, to take his
latitude, and ascertain how far the elements have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
driven him from his true course. Let us imitate this prudence,
and, before we float farther on the waves of this
debate, refer to the point from which we departed, that
we may at least be able to conjecture where we now are.
I ask for the reading of the resolution before the Senate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The resolution
which
caused the
debate.</div>

<p>[The Secretary read the resolution, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Resolved</i>, That the Committee on Public Lands be
instructed to inquire and report the quantity of public
lands remaining unsold within each State
and Territory, and whether it be expedient
to limit for a certain period the sales of the
public lands to such lands only as have heretofore
been offered for sale, and are now subject to
entry at the minimum price. And, also, whether the
office of Surveyor-General, and some of the land offices,
may not be abolished without detriment to the public
interest; or whether it be expedient to adopt measures
to hasten the sales and extend more rapidly the surveys
of the public lands.&rdquo;]</p>

<p>We have thus heard, Sir, what the resolution is
which is actually before us for consideration; and it
will readily occur to every one, that it is almost the
only subject about which something has not been said
in the speech, running through two days, by which the
Senate has been entertained by the gentleman from
South Carolina. Every topic in the wide range of our
public affairs, whether past or present,&mdash;everything,
general or local, whether belonging to national politics
or party politics,&mdash;seems to have attracted more or
less of the honorable member&rsquo;s attention, save only the
resolution before the Senate. He has spoken of everything
but the public lands; they have escaped his
notice. To that subject, in all his excursions, he has
not paid even the cold respect of a passing glance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Hayne&rsquo;s
&ldquo;return-shot.&rdquo;</div>

<p>When this debate, Sir, was to be resumed, on Thursday
morning, it so happened that it would have been
convenient for me to be elsewhere. The
honorable member, however, did not incline
to put off the discussion to another day. He
had a shot, he said, to return, and he wished to discharge
it. That shot, Sir, which he thus kindly informed
us was coming, that we might stand out of the
way, or prepare ourselves to fall by it and die with
decency, has now been received. Under all advantages,
and with expectation awakened by the tone
which preceded it, it has been discharged, and has
spent its force. It may become me to say no more of
its effect than that, if nobody is found, after all, either
killed or wounded, it is not the first time, in the history
of human affairs, that the vigor and success of the
war have not quite come up to the lofty and sounding
phrase of the manifesto.</p>

<p>The gentleman, Sir, in declining to postpone the
debate, told the Senate, with the emphasis of his hand
upon his heart, that there was something rankling <i>here</i>,
which he wished to relieve. [Mr. Hayne rose, and
disclaimed having used the word <i>rankling</i>.] It would
not, Mr. President, be safe for the honorable member
to appeal to those around him, upon the question
whether he did in fact make use of that word. But
he may have been unconscious of it. At any rate, it is
enough that he disclaims it. But still, with or without
the use of that particular word, he had yet something
<i>here</i>, he said, of which he wished to rid himself by an
immediate reply. In this respect, Sir, I have a great
advantage over the honorable gentleman. There is
nothing <i>here</i>, Sir, which gives me the slightest uneasiness;
neither fear, nor anger, nor that which is some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>times
more troublesome than either, the consciousness
of having been in the wrong. There is nothing, either
originating <i>here</i>, or now received <i>here</i> by the gentleman&rsquo;s
shot. Nothing originating here, for I had not
the slightest feeling of unkindness towards the honorable
member. Some passages, it is true, had occurred
since our acquaintance in this body, which I could
have wished might have been otherwise; but I had
used philosophy and forgotten them. I paid the honorable
member the attention of listening with respect to
his first speech; and when he sat down, though surprised,
and I must even say astonished, at some of his
opinions, nothing was farther from my intention than
to commence any personal warfare. Through the whole
of the few remarks I made in answer, I avoided, studiously
and carefully, everything which I thought possible
to be construed into disrespect. And, Sir, while
there is thus nothing originating <i>here</i> which I have
wished at any time, or now wish, to discharge, I must
repeat, also, that nothing has been received <i>here</i> which
<i>rankles</i>, or in any way gives me annoyance. I will not
accuse the honorable member of violating the rules of
civilized war; I will not say that he poisoned his
arrows. But whether his shafts were or were not
dipped in that which would have caused rankling if
they had reached their destination, there was not, as it
happened, quite strength enough in the bow to bring
them to their mark. If he wishes now to gather up
those shafts, he must look for them elsewhere; they
will not be found fixed and quivering in the object at
which they were aimed.</p>

<p>The honorable member complained that I had slept
on his speech. I must have slept on it, or not slept at
all. The moment the honorable member sat down, his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
friend from Missouri rose, and, with much honeyed
commendation of the speech, suggested that the impressions
which it had produced were too charming and
delightful to be disturbed by other sentiments or other
sounds, and proposed that the Senate should adjourn.
Would it have been quite amiable in me, Sir, to interrupt
this excellent good feeling? Must I not have
been absolutely malicious, if I could have thrust myself
forward, to destroy sensations thus pleasing? Was it
not much better and kinder, both to sleep upon them
myself, and to allow others also the pleasure of sleeping
upon them? But if it be meant, by sleeping upon his
speech, that I took time to prepare a reply to it, it is
quite a mistake. Owing to other engagements, I could
not employ even the interval between the adjournment
of the Senate and its meeting the next morning, in
attention to the subject of this debate. Nevertheless,
Sir, the mere matter of fact is undoubtedly true. I did
sleep on the gentleman&rsquo;s speech, and slept soundly.
And I slept equally well on his speech of yesterday, to
which I am now replying. It is quite possible that in
this respect, also, I possess some advantage over the
honorable member, attributable, doubtless, to a cooler
temperament on my part; for, in truth, I slept upon his
speeches remarkably well.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thomas H.
Benton&rsquo;s

<p>But the gentleman inquires why <i>he</i> was made the
object of such a reply. Why was <i>he</i> singled out? If
an attack has been made on the East, he, he
assures us, did not begin it; it was made by
the gentleman from Missouri. Sir, I answered
the gentleman&rsquo;s speech because I
happened to hear it; and because, also, I chose to give
an answer to that speech, which, if unanswered, I
thought most likely to produce injurious impressions.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>I did not stop to inquire who was the original drawer
of the bill. I found a responsible indorser before me,
and it was my purpose to hold him liable, and to bring
him to his just responsibility, without delay. But,
Sir, this interrogatory of the honorable member was
only introductory to another. He proceeded to ask me
whether I had turned
upon him, in this debate,
from the consciousness
that I should find an
overmatch, if I ventured
on a contest with his
friend from Missouri.
If, Sir, the honorable
member, <i>modesti&aelig; gratia</i>,
had chosen thus to defer
to his friend, and to pay
him a compliment, without
intentional disparagement
to others, it
would have been quite
according to the friendly
courtesies of debate, and
not at all ungrateful to my own feelings. I am not one
of those, Sir, who esteem any tribute of regard, whether
light and occasional, or more serious and deliberate,
which may be bestowed on others, as so much unjustly
withholden from themselves. But the tone and manner
of the gentleman&rsquo;s question forbid me thus to interpret
it. I am not at liberty to consider it as nothing more
than a civility to his friend. It had an air of taunt and
disparagement, something of the loftiness of asserted
superiority, which does not allow me to pass it over
without notice. It was put as a question for me to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
answer, and so put as if it were difficult for me to
answer, whether I deemed the member from Missouri
an overmatch for myself in debate here. It seems to
me, Sir, that this is extraordinary language, and an
extraordinary tone, for the discussions of this body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Senate
of equals.</div>

<p>Matches and overmatches! Those terms are more
applicable elsewhere than here, and fitter for other
assemblies than this. Sir, the gentleman
seems to forget where and what we are.
This is a Senate, a Senate of equals, of men of individual
honor and personal character, and of absolute
independence. We know no masters, we acknowledge
no dictators. This is a hall for mutual consultation
and discussion; not an arena for the exhibition of
champions. I offer myself, Sir, as a match for no man;
I throw the challenge of debate at no man&rsquo;s feet. But
then, Sir, since the honorable member has put the
question in a manner that calls for an answer, I will
give him an answer; and I tell him, that, holding
myself to be the humblest of the members here, I yet
know nothing in the arm of his friend from Missouri,
either alone or when aided by the arm of <i>his</i> friend
from South Carolina, that need deter even me from
espousing whatever opinions I may choose to espouse,
from debating whenever I may choose to debate, or
from speaking whatever I may see fit to say, on the
floor of the Senate. Sir, when uttered as matter of
commendation or compliment, I should dissent from
nothing which the honorable member might say of his
friend. Still less do I put forth any pretensions of my
own. But when put to me as matter of taunt, I throw
it back, and say to the gentleman that he could possibly
say nothing less likely than such a comparison to
wound my pride of personal character. The anger of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
its tone rescued the remark from intentional irony,
which otherwise, probably, would have been its general
acceptation. But, Sir, if it be imagined that, by this
mutual quotation and commendation; if it be supposed
that, by casting the characters of the drama, assigning
to each his part,&mdash;to one the attack, to another the cry
of onset; or if it be thought that, by a loud and empty
vaunt of anticipated victory, any laurels are to be won
here; if it be imagined, especially, that any or all these
things will shake any purpose of mine, I can tell the
honorable member, once for all, that he is greatly
mistaken, and that he is dealing with one of whose
temper and character he has yet much to learn. Sir, I
shall not allow myself, on this occasion, I hope on no
occasion, to be betrayed into any loss of temper; but if
provoked, as I trust I never shall be, into crimination
and recrimination, the honorable member may perhaps
find, that, in that contest, there will be blows to take
as well as blows to give; that others can state comparisons
as significant, at least, as his own; and that his
impunity may possibly demand of him whatever powers
of taunt and sarcasm he may possess. I commend him
to a prudent husbandry of his resources.</p>

<p>But, Sir, the Coalition!<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The Coalition! Ay, &ldquo;the

led or frighted into this debate by the spectre of the
Coalition. &ldquo;Was it the ghost of the murdered
Coali<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>tion,&rdquo; he exclaims, &ldquo;which haunted the member from
Massachusetts; and which, like the ghost of Banquo,
would never down?&rdquo; &ldquo;The murdered Coalition!&rdquo;
Sir, this charge of a coalition, in
reference to the late administration, is not original with
the honorable member. It did not spring up in the
Senate. Whether as a fact, as an argument, or as an
embellishment, it is
all borrowed. He
adopts it, indeed,
from a very low origin,
and a still lower
present condition. It
is one of the thousand
calumnies with which
the press teemed, during
an excited political
canvass. It was a
charge, of which there
was not only no proof
or probability, but
which was in itself
wholly impossible to
be true. No man of
common information
ever believed a syllable
of it. Yet it was of that class of falsehoods which,
by continued repetition, through all the organs of detraction
and abuse, are capable of misleading those who
are already far misled, and of further fanning passion
already kindling into flame. Doubtless it served in its
day, and in greater or less degree, the end designed by
it. Having done that, it has sunk into the general
mass of stale and loathed calumnies. It is the very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
cast-off slough of a polluted and shameless press. Incapable
of further mischief, it lies in the sewer, lifeless
and despised. It is not now, Sir, in the power of the
honorable member to give it dignity or decency, by
attempting to elevate it, and to introduce it into the
Senate. He cannot change it from what it is, an
object of general disgust and scorn. On the contrary,
the contact, if he choose to touch it, is more likely
to drag him down, down, to the place where it lies
itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An infelicitous
allusion
by Hayne.</div>

<p>But, Sir, the honorable member was not, for other
reasons, entirely happy in his allusion to the story of
Banquo&rsquo;s murder and Banquo&rsquo;s ghost. It
was not, I think, the friends, but the enemies
of the murdered Banquo, at whose bidding
his spirit would not down. The honorable gentleman
is fresh in his reading of the English classics, and can
put me right if I am wrong; but, according to my poor
recollection, it was at those who had begun with
caresses and ended with foul and treacherous murder
that the gory locks were shaken. The ghost of Banquo,
like that of Hamlet, was an honest ghost. It
disturbed no innocent man. It knew where its appearance
would strike terror, and who would cry out, A
ghost! It made itself visible in the right quarter, and
compelled the guilty and the conscience-smitten, and
none others, to start, with,</p>

</p>

<p class="noidt">Their eyeballs were seared (was it not so, Sir?) who
had thought to shield themselves by concealing their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
own hand, and laying the imputation of the crime on
a low and hireling agency in wickedness; who had
vainly attempted to stifle the workings of their own
coward consciences by ejaculating through white lips
and chattering teeth, &ldquo;Thou canst not say I did it!&rdquo;
I have misread the great poet if those who had no way
partaken in the deed of the death, either found that
they were, or feared that they should be, pushed from
their stools by the ghost of the slain, or exclaimed to a
spectre created by their own fears and their own remorse,
&ldquo;Avaunt! and quit our sight!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is another particular, Sir, in which the honorable
member&rsquo;s quick perception of resemblances might,
I should think, have seen something in the story of
Banquo, making it not altogether a subject of the most
pleasant contemplation. Those who murdered Banquo,
what did they win by it? Substantial good?
Permanent power? Or disappointment, rather, and
sore mortification,&mdash;dust and ashes, the common fate
of vaulting ambition overleaping itself? Did not evenhanded
justice ere-long commend the poisoned chalice
to their own lips? Did they not soon find that for
another they had &ldquo;filed their mind&rdquo;? that their ambition,
though apparently for the moment successful, had
but put a barren sceptre in their grasp? Ay, Sir,</p>

<p>Sir, I need pursue the allusion no farther. I leave
the honorable gentleman to run it out at his leisure,
and to derive from it all the gratification it is calculated
to administer. If he finds himself pleased with the
associations, and prepared to be quite satisfied, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the parallel should be entirely completed, I had almost
said, I am satisfied also; but that I shall think of.
Yes, Sir, I will think of that.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Ordinance
of 1787.</div>

<div class="sidenote">What Webster
said,
and did not
say, about
slavery.</div>

<p>I spoke, Sir, of the Ordinance of 1787,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> which prohibits
slavery, in all future times, northwest of the
Ohio, as a measure of great wisdom and foresight,
and one which had been attended with
highly beneficial and permanent consequences.
I supposed that on this point no two gentlemen in
the Senate could entertain different opinions. But
the simple expression of this sentiment has led the
gentleman not only into a labored defence of slavery,
in the abstract, and on principle, but also into a warm
accusation against me, as having attacked the system
of domestic slavery now existing in the Southern
States. For all this, there was not the slightest foundation
in anything said or intimated by me. I did
not utter a single word which any ingenuity could
torture into an attack on the slavery of the South. I
said, only, that it was highly wise and useful, in
legis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>lating for the Northwestern country while it was yet
a wilderness, to prohibit the introduction of slaves;
and I added that I presumed there was no
reflecting and intelligent person, in the
neighboring State of Kentucky, who would
doubt that, if the same prohibition had been
extended, at the same early period, over that commonwealth,
her strength and population would, at
this day, have been far greater than they are. If these
opinions be thought doubtful, they are nevertheless, I
trust, neither extraordinary nor disrespectful. They
attack nobody and menace nobody. And yet, Sir, the
gentleman&rsquo;s optics have discovered, even in the mere
expression of this sentiment, what he calls the very
spirit of the Missouri question! He represents me as
making an onset on the whole South, and manifesting
a spirit which would interfere with, and disturb, their
domestic condition!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Slavery a
matter of
domestic
policy, left
with the States.</div>

<div class="sidenote">But a great
evil.</div>

<p>Sir, this injustice no otherwise surprises me, than
as it is committed here, and committed without the
slightest pretence of ground for it. I say it only
surprises me as being done here; for I know full well
that it is, and has been, the settled policy of some persons
in the South, for years, to represent the people of
the North as disposed to interfere with them in their
own exclusive and peculiar concerns. This is a delicate
and sensitive point in Southern feeling; and of
late years it has always been touched, and generally
with effect, whenever the object has been to unite the
whole South against Northern men or Northern measures.
This feeling, always carefully kept alive, and
maintained at too intense a heat to admit discrimination
or reflection, is a lever of great power in our
political machine. It moves vast bodies, and gives to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
them one and the same direction. But it is without
adequate cause, and the suspicion which exists is
wholly groundless. There is not, and never has been,
a disposition in the North to interfere with these interests
of the South. Such interference has never been
supposed to be within the power of government; nor
has it been in any way attempted. The slavery of the
South has always been regarded as a matter
of domestic policy, left with the States themselves,
and with which the Federal government
had nothing to do. Certainly, Sir, I
am, and ever have been, of that opinion.
The gentleman, indeed, argues that slavery, in the
abstract, is no evil. Most assuredly I need not say I
differ with him, altogether and most widely, on that
point. I regard domestic slavery as one of the greatest
evils, both moral and political. But whether
it be a malady, and whether it be curable, and
if so, by what means; or, on the other hand, whether it
be the <i>vulnus immedicabile</i> of the social system, I leave
it to those whose right and duty it is to inquire and to
decide. And this I believe, Sir, is, and uniformly has
been, the sentiment of the North.</p>

lands.</div>

broad view
of national
relations to

<div class="sidenote">Public
works are
bonds of

<p>We approach, at length, Sir, to a more important
part of the honorable gentleman&rsquo;s observations. Since
it does not accord with my views of justice
and policy to give away the public lands
altogether, as a mere matter of gratuity, I am asked by
the honorable gentleman on what ground it is that I
consent to vote them away in particular instances.
How, he inquires, do I reconcile with these professed
sentiments, my support of measures appropriating portions
of the lands to particular roads, particular canals,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
particular rivers, and particular institutions of education
in the West? This leads, Sir, to the real and
wide difference in political opinion between the honorable
gentleman and myself. On my part, I look upon
all these objects as connected with the common good,
fairly embraced in its object and its terms; he, on the
contrary, deems them all, if good at all, only local
good. This is our difference. The interrogatory
which he proceeded to put at once explains this difference.
&ldquo;What interest,&rdquo; asks he, &ldquo;has South Carolina
in a canal in Ohio?&rdquo; Sir, this very question is full of
significance. It develops the gentleman&rsquo;s whole political
system; and its answer expounds mine. Here we
differ. I look upon a road over the Alleghanies, a
canal round the falls of the Ohio, or a canal
or railway from the Atlantic to the Western
waters, as being an object large and extensive
enough to be fairly said to be for the common
benefit. The gentleman thinks otherwise,
and this is the key to his construction of the powers of
the government. He may well ask what interest has
South Carolina in a canal in Ohio. On his system, it
is true, she has no interest. On that system, Ohio
and Carolina are different governments, and different
countries; connected here, it is true, by some slight and
ill-defined bond of union, but in all main
respects separate and diverse. On that system,
Carolina has no more interest in a canal
in Ohio than in Mexico. The gentleman,
therefore, only follows out his own principles; he does
no more than arrive at the natural conclusions of his
own doctrines; he only announces the true results of
that creed which he has adopted himself, and would
persuade others to adopt, when he thus declares that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
South Carolina has no interest in a public work in
Ohio.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The States
are one.</div>

<p>Sir, we narrow-minded people of New England do
not reason thus. Our notion of things is entirely
different. We look upon the States, not as separated,
but as united. We love to dwell on that union, and on
the mutual happiness which it has so much promoted,
and the common renown which it has so greatly contributed
to acquire. In our contemplation, Carolina
and Ohio are parts of the same country; States, united
under the same general government, having interests
common, associated, intermingled. In whatever is
within the proper sphere of the constitutional power of
this government, we look upon the States as
one. We do not impose geographical limits
to our patriotic feeling or regard; we do not follow
rivers and mountains, and lines of latitude, to find
boundaries, beyond which public improvements do not
benefit us. We who come here, as agents and representatives
of these narrow-minded and selfish men of
New England, consider ourselves as bound to regard
with an equal eye the good of the whole, in whatever
is within our powers of legislation. Sir, if a railroad
or canal, beginning in South Carolina and ending in
South Carolina, appeared to me to be of national importance
and national magnitude, believing, as I do,
that the power of government extends to the encouragement
of works of that description, if I were to stand
up here and ask, What interest has Massachusetts in a
railroad in South Carolina? I should not be willing to
face my constituents. These same narrow-minded men
would tell me that they had sent me to act for the
whole country, and that one who possessed too little
comprehension, either of intellect or feeling, one who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
was not large enough, both in mind and in heart, to
embrace the whole, was not fit to be intrusted with the
interest of any part.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The powers
of the government
to be
used for the
general
benefit of
the whole.</div>

<div class="sidenote">One in war,
in peace,
and in
commerce.</div>

<p>Sir, I do not desire to enlarge the powers of the government
by unjustifiable construction, nor to exercise
any not within a fair interpretation. But
when it is believed that a power does exist,
then it is, in my judgment, to be exercised
for the general benefit of the whole.  So far
as respects the exercise of such a power, the
States are one. It was the very object of
the Constitution to create unity of interests to the
extent of the powers of the general government. In
war and peace we are one; in commerce,
one; because the authority of the general
government reaches to war and peace, and to
the regulation of commerce. I have never
seen any more difficulty in erecting light-houses on the
lakes than on the ocean; in improving the harbors of
inland seas, than if they were within the ebb and flow
of the tide; or in removing obstructions in the vast
streams of the West, more than in any work to facilitate
commerce on the Atlantic coast. If there be any
power for one, there is power also for the other; and
they are all and equally for the common good of the
country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The government
a great
untaxed
proprietor.</div>

<p>There are other objects, apparently more local, or
the benefit of which is less general, towards which,
nevertheless, I have concurred with others to give aid
by donations of land. It is proposed to construct a
road, in or through one of the new States, in which
this government possesses large quantities of land.
Have the United States no right, or, as a great and
untaxed proprietor, are they under no obligation to
con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>tribute to an object thus calculated to promote the
common good of all the proprietors, themselves included?
And even with respect to education, which
is the extreme case, let the question be considered. In
the first place, as we have seen, it was made matter of
compact with these States, that they should do their
part to promote education. In the next place, our
whole system of land laws proceeds on the idea that
education is for the common good; because in every
division a certain portion is uniformly reserved and
appropriated for the use of schools. And, finally,
have not these new States singularly strong claims,
founded on the ground already stated, that
the government is a great untaxed proprietor,
in the ownership of the soil? It is a consideration
of great importance, that probably
there is in no part of the country, or of the world, so
great call for the means of education, as in these new
States, owing to the vast numbers of persons within
those ages in which education and instruction are
usually received, if received at all. This is the natural
consequence of recency of settlement and rapid increase.
The census of these States shows how great a
proportion of the whole population occupies the classes
between infancy and manhood. These are the wide
fields, and here is the deep and quick soil for the seeds
of knowledge and virtue; and this is the favored season,
the very spring-time for sowing them. Let them
be disseminated without stint. Let them be scattered
with a bountiful hand, broadcast. Whatever the government
can fairly do towards these objects, in my
opinion, ought to be done.</p>

<p>These, Sir, are the grounds, succinctly stated, on
which my votes for grants of lands for particular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
objects rest; while I maintain, at the same time, that
it is all a common fund, for the common benefit. And
reasons like these, I presume, have influenced the
votes of other gentlemen from New England. Those
who have a different view of the powers of the government,
of course, come to different conclusions, on
these, as on other questions. I observed, when speaking
on this subject before, that if we looked to any
measure, whether for a road, a canal, or anything else,
intended for the improvement of the West, it would be
found that if the New England <i>ayes</i> were struck out
of the lists of votes, the Southern <i>noes</i> would always
have rejected the measure. The truth of this has not
been denied, and cannot be denied. In stating this,
I thought it just to ascribe it to the constitutional
scruples of the South, rather than to any other less
favorable or less charitable cause. But no sooner had
I done this, than the honorable gentleman asks if I
reproach him and his friends with their constitutional
scruples. Sir, I reproach nobody. I stated a fact, and
gave the most respectful reason for it that occurred to
me. The gentleman cannot deny the fact; he may, if
he choose, disclaim the reason. It is not long since I
had occasion, in presenting a petition from his own
State, to account for its being intrusted to my hands,
by saying that the constitutional opinions of the gentleman
and his worthy colleague prevented them from
supporting it. Sir, did I state this as matter of reproach?
Far from it. Did I attempt to find any other
cause than an honest one for these scruples? Sir, I did
not. It did not become me to doubt or to insinuate
that the gentleman had either changed his sentiments,
or that he had made up a set of constitutional opinions
accommodated to any particular combination of politi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>cal
occurrences. Had I done so, I should have felt
that, while I was entitled to little credit in thus questioning
other people&rsquo;s motives, I justified the whole
world in suspecting my own. But how has the gentleman
returned this respect for others&rsquo; opinions? His
own candor and justice, how have they been exhibited
towards the motives of others, while he has been at so
much pains to maintain, what nobody has disputed, the
purity of his own? Why, Sir, he has asked <i>when</i>, and
<i>how</i>, and <i>why</i> New England votes were found going for
measures favorable to the West. He has demanded to
be informed whether all this did not begin in 1825, and
while the election of President was still pending.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New England&rsquo;s
aid to
Western improvements.</div>

<p>Sir, to these questions retort would be justified; and
it is both cogent and at hand. Nevertheless, I will
answer the inquiry, not by retort, but by facts. I will
tell the gentleman <i>when</i>, and <i>how</i>, and <i>why</i> New England
has supported measures favorable to the West. I
have already referred to the early history of the government,
to the first acquisition of the lands, to the
original laws for disposing of them, and for governing
the territories where they lie; and have shown the
influence of New England men and New England principles
in all these leading measures. I should not be
pardoned were I to go over that ground again. Coming
to more recent times, and to measures of a less general
character, I have endeavored to prove that everything
of this kind, designed for Western improvement,
has depended on the votes of New
England; all this is true beyond the power
of contradiction. And now, Sir, there are
two measures to which I will refer, not so ancient as
to belong to the early history of the public lands, and
not so recent as to be on this side of the period when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
the gentleman charitably imagines a new direction may
have been given to New England feeling and New
England votes. These measures, and the New England
votes in support of them, may be taken as samples
and specimens of all the rest.</p>

<span class="caption"><i>Robert Y. Hayne.</i></span>
</div>

<p>In 1820 (observe, Mr. President, in 1820) the people
of the West besought Congress for a reduction in the
price of lands. In
favor of that reduction,
New England,
with a delegation of
forty members in the
other house, gave
thirty-three votes, and
one only against it.
The four Southern
States, with more than
fifty members, gave
thirty-two votes for
it, and seven against
it. Again, in 1821
(observe again, Sir,
the time), the law
passed for the relief
of the purchasers of
the public lands. This
was a measure of vital importance to the West, and
more especially to the Southwest. It authorized the
relinquishment of contracts for lands which had been
entered into at high prices, and a reduction in other
cases of not less than thirty-seven and a half per cent
on the purchase-money. Many millions of dollars, six
or seven, I believe, probably much more, were relinquished
by this law. On this bill, New England, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
her forty members, gave more affirmative votes than the
four Southern States, with their fifty-two or fifty-three
members. These two are far the most important general
measures respecting the public lands which have
been adopted within the last twenty years. They took
place in 1820 and 1821. That is the time <i>when</i>.</p>

<p>As to the manner <i>how</i>, the gentleman already sees
that it was by voting in solid column for the required
relief; and, lastly, as to the cause <i>why</i>, I tell the
gentleman it was because the members from New England
thought the measures just and salutary; because
they entertained towards the West neither envy, hatred,
nor malice; because they deemed it becoming them, as
just and enlightened public men, to meet the exigency
which had arisen in the West with the appropriate
measure of relief; because they felt it due to their own
characters, and the characters of their New England
predecessors in this government, to act towards the
new States in the spirit of a liberal, patronizing, magnanimous
policy. So much, Sir, for the cause <i>why</i>;
and I hope that by this time, Sir, the honorable gentleman
is satisfied; if not, I do not know <i>when</i>, or <i>how</i>, or
<i>why</i> he ever will be.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hayne&rsquo;s
attack on
New England.</div>

<p>Professing to be provoked by what he chose to consider
a charge made by me against South Carolina, the
honorable member, Mr. President, has taken
up a new crusade against New England.
Leaving altogether the subject of the public
lands, in which his success, perhaps, had
been neither distinguished nor satisfactory, and letting
go, also, of the topic of the tariff, he sallied forth in a
general assault on the opinions, politics, and parties of
New England, as they have been exhibited in the last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
thirty years. This is natural. The &ldquo;narrow policy&rdquo;
of the public lands had proved a legal settlement in
South Carolina, and was not to be removed. The
&ldquo;accursed policy&rdquo; of the tariff, also, had established
the fact of its birth and parentage in the same State.
No wonder, therefore, the gentleman wished to carry
the war, as he expressed it, into the enemy&rsquo;s country.
Prudently willing to quit these subjects, he was, doubtless,
desirous of fastening on others, which could not
be transferred south of Mason and Dixon&rsquo;s line.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The
politics of New England became his theme; and it was
in this part of his speech, I think, that he menaced me
with such sore discomfiture. Discomfiture! Why, Sir,
when he attacks anything which I maintain, and overthrows
it, when he turns the right or left of any position
which I take up, when he drives me from any ground I
choose to occupy, he may then talk of discomfiture, but
not till that distant day. What has he done? Has he
maintained his own charges? Has he proved what he
alleged? Has he sustained himself in his attack on
the government, and on the history of the North, in
the matter of the public lands? Has he disproved a
fact, refuted a proposition, weakened an argument,
maintained by me? Has he come within beat of drum
of any position of mine? Oh, no; but he has &ldquo;carried
the war into the enemy&rsquo;s country&rdquo;! Carried the war
into the enemy&rsquo;s country! Yes, Sir, and what sort of
a war has he made of it? Why, Sir, he has stretched
a drag-net over the whole surface of perished pamphlets,
indiscreet sermons, frothy paragraphs, and fuming
popular addresses,&mdash;over whatever the pulpit in its
moments of alarm, the press in its heats, and parties in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
their extravagance, have severally thrown off in times
of general excitement and violence. He has thus swept
together a mass of such things as, but that they are now
old and cold, the public health would have required
him rather to leave in their state of dispersion. For a
good long hour or two we had the unbroken pleasure
of listening to the honorable member while he recited
with his usual grace and spirit, and with evident high
gusto, speeches, pamphlets, addresses, and all the <i>et
c&aelig;teras</i> of the political press, such as warm heads produce
in warm times; and such as it would be &ldquo;discomfiture&rdquo;
indeed for any one, whose taste did not delight
in that sort of reading, to be obliged to peruse. This
is his war. This it is to carry war into the enemy&rsquo;s
country. It is in an invasion of this sort that he
flatters himself with the expectation of gaining laurels
fit to adorn a Senator&rsquo;s brow!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Party contests under the Constitution.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Political attacks upon Washington.</div>

<p>Mr. President, I shall not&mdash;it will not, I trust, be
expected that I should&mdash;either now or at any time,
separate this farrago into parts, and answer
and examine its components. I shall barely
bestow upon it all a general remark or two.
In the run of forty years, Sir, under this
Constitution, we have experienced sundry successive
violent party contests. Party arose, indeed, with the
Constitution itself, and, in some form or other, has
attended it through the greater part of its history.
Whether any other constitution than the old Articles
of Confederation was desirable, was itself a question
on which parties divided; if a new constitution were
framed, what powers should be given to it was another
question; and when it had been formed, what was, in
fact, the just extent of the powers actually conferred
was a third. Parties, as we know, existed under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
first administration, as distinctly marked as those which
have manifested themselves at any subsequent period.
The contest immediately preceding the political change
in 1801, and that, again, which existed at the commencement
of the late war, are other instances of party
excitement of something more than usual strength and
intensity. In all these conflicts there was, no doubt,
much of violence on both and all sides. It would be
impossible, if one had a fancy for such employment, to
adjust the relative <i>quantum</i> of violence between these
contending parties. There was enough in each, as
must always be expected in popular governments.
With a great deal of popular and decorous discussion,
there was mingled a great deal, also, of declamation,
virulence, crimination, and abuse. In regard to any
party, probably, at one of the leading epochs in the
history of parties, enough may be found to make out
another inflamed exhibition, not unlike that with which
the honorable member has edified us. For myself, Sir,
I shall not rake among the rubbish of bygone times to
see what I can find, or whether I cannot find something
by which I can fix a blot on the escutcheon of any
State, any party, or any part of the country.
General Washington&rsquo;s administration was
steadily and zealously maintained, as we all know,
by New England. It was violently
opposed elsewhere. We know in what quarter he had
the most earnest, constant, and persevering support, in
all his great and leading measures. We know where
his private and personal character was held in the
highest degree of attachment and veneration; and we
know, too, where his measures were opposed, his services
slighted, and his character vilified. We know,
or we might know, if we turned to the journals, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
expressed respect, gratitude, and regret, when he retired
from the chief magistracy, and who refused to express
either respect, gratitude, or regret. I shall not open
those journals. Publications more abusive or scurrilous
never saw the light, than were sent forth against Washington
and all his leading measures, from presses south
of New England. But I shall not look them up. I
employ no scavengers; no one is in attendance on me,
furnishing such means of retaliation; and if there were,
with an ass&rsquo;s load of them, with a bulk as huge as that
which the gentleman himself has produced, I would not
touch one of them. I see enough of the violence of our
own times, to be no way anxious to rescue from forgetfulness
the extravagances of times past.</p>

<p>Besides, what is all this to the present purpose? It
has nothing to do with the public lands, in regard to
which the attack was begun; and it has nothing to do
with those sentiments and opinions which, I have
thought, tend to disunion, and all of which the honorable
member seems to have adopted himself, and undertaken
to defend. New England has, at times, so argues
the gentleman, held opinions as dangerous as those
which he now holds. Suppose this were so; why
should <i>he</i> therefore abuse New England? If he finds
himself countenanced by acts of hers, how is it that,
while he relies on these acts, he covers, or seeks to
cover, their authors with reproach? But, Sir, if, in
the course of forty years, there have been undue effervescences
of party in New England, has the same thing
happened nowhere else? Party animosity and party
outrage, not in New England, but elsewhere, denounced
President Washington, not only as a Federalist, but as
a Tory, a British agent, a man who, in his high office,
sanctioned corruption. But does the honorable member<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
suppose, if I had a tender here who should put such an
effusion of wickedness and folly into my hand, that I
would stand up and read it against the South? Parties
ran into great heats again in 1799 and 1800. What was
said, Sir, or rather what was not said, in those years,
against John Adams, one of the committee that drafted
the Declaration of Independence, and its admitted
ablest defender on the floor of Congress? If the gentleman
wishes to increase his stores of party abuse and
frothy violence, if he has a determined proclivity to
such pursuits, there are treasures of that sort south of
the Potomac, much to his taste, yet untouched. I shall
not touch them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Political parties in 1812.</div>

<p>The parties which divided the country at the commencement
of the late war were violent. But then
there was violence on both sides, and violence
in every State. Minorities and majorities
were equally violent. There was no
more violence against the war in New England than
in other States; nor any more appearance of violence,
except that, owing to a dense population, greater
facility of assembling, and more presses, there may
have been more in quantity spoken and printed there
than in some other places. In the article of sermons,
too, New England is somewhat more abundant than
South Carolina; and for that reason the chance of finding
here and there an exceptionable one may be greater.
I hope, too, there are more good ones. Opposition
may have been more formidable in New England, as
it embraced a larger portion of the whole population;
but it was no more unrestrained in principle, or violent
in manner. The minorities dealt quite as harshly with
their own State governments as the majorities dealt
with the administration here. There were presses on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
both sides, popular meetings on both sides, ay, and
pulpits on both sides also. The gentleman&rsquo;s purveyors
have only catered for him among the productions of
one side. I certainly shall not supply the deficiency
by furnishing samples of the other. I leave to him,
and to them, the whole concern.</p>

<p>It is enough for me to say that if, in any part of this
their grateful occupation, if, in all their researches, they
find anything in the history of Massachusetts, or New
England, or in the proceedings of any legislative or
other public body, disloyal to the Union, speaking
slightingly of its value, proposing to break it up, or
recommending non-intercourse with neighboring States,
on account of difference of political opinion, then, Sir,
I give them all up to the honorable gentleman&rsquo;s unrestrained
rebuke; expecting, however, that he will
extend his buffetings in like manner <i>to all similar
proceedings, wherever else found</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tribute to South Carolina.</div>

<p>The eulogium pronounced by the honorable gentleman
on the character of the State of South Carolina,
for her Revolutionary and other merits, meets
my hearty concurrence. I shall not acknowledge
that the honorable member goes before
me in regard for whatever of distinguished talent, or
distinguished character, South Carolina has produced.
I claim part of the honor, I partake in the pride, of her
great names. I claim them for countrymen, one and
all, the Laurenses, the Rutledges, the Pinckneys, the
Sumpters, the Marions, Americans all, whose fame is
no more to be hemmed in by State lines, than their
talents and patriotism were capable of being circumscribed
within the same narrow limits. In their day
and generation they served and honored the country,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
and the whole country; and their renown is of the
treasures of the whole country. Him whose honored
name the gentleman himself bears,&mdash;does he esteem me
less capable of gratitude for his patriotism, or sympathy
for his sufferings, than if his eyes had first opened upon
the light of Massachusetts, instead of South Carolina?
Sir, does he suppose it in his power to exhibit a Carolina
name so bright as to produce envy in my bosom?
No, Sir, increased gratification and delight, rather. I
thank God that, if I am gifted with little of the spirit
which is able to raise mortals to the skies, I have yet
none, as I trust, of that other spirit, which would drag
angels down. When I shall be found, Sir, in my place
here in the Senate, or elsewhere, to sneer at public
merit, because it happens to spring up beyond the little
limits of my own State or neighborhood; when I refuse,
for any such cause or for any cause, the homage due
to American talent, to elevated patriotism, to sincere
devotion to liberty and the country; or, if I see an
uncommon endowment of Heaven, if I see extraordinary
capacity and virtue, in any son of the South, and
if, moved by local prejudice or gangrened by State
jealousy, I get up here to abate the tithe of a hair from
his just character and just fame, may my tongue cleave
to the roof of my mouth!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Massachusetts
and South Carolina
in the Revolution.</div>

<p>Sir, let me recur to pleasing recollections; let me
indulge in refreshing remembrance of the past; let me
remind you that, in early times, no States
cherished greater harmony, both of principle
and feeling, than Massachusetts and South
Carolina.  Would to God that harmony
might again return! Shoulder to shoulder
they went through the Revolution, hand in hand they
stood round the administration of Washington, and felt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
his own great arm lean on them for support. Unkind
feeling, if it exist, alienation, and distrust are the
growth, unnatural to such soils, of false principles
since sown. They are weeds, the seeds of which that
same great arm never scattered.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I shall enter on no encomium upon
Massachusetts; she needs none. There she is. Behold
her, and judge for yourselves. There is her
history; the world knows it by heart. The
past, at least, is secure. There is Boston,
and Concord, and Lexington, and Bunker Hill; and
there they will remain forever. The bones of her
sons, falling in the great struggle for Independence,
now lie mingled with the soil of every State from New
England to Georgia; and there they will lie forever.
And, Sir, where American Liberty raised its first voice,
and where its youth was nurtured and sustained, there
it still lives, in the strength of its manhood and full of
its original spirit. If discord and disunion shall wound
it, if party strife and blind ambition shall hawk at and
tear it, if folly and madness, if uneasiness under salutary
and necessary restraint, shall succeed in separating
it from that Union by which alone its existence is made
sure, it will stand, in the end, by the side of that cradle
in which its infancy was rocked; it will stretch forth
its arm with whatever of vigor it may still retain over
the friends who gather round it; and it will fall at last,
if fall it must, amidst the proudest monuments of its
own glory, and on the very spot of its origin.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The true
principles of
the Constitution.</div>

<p>There yet remains to be performed, Mr. President, by
far the most grave and important duty which I feel to
be devolved on me by this occasion. It is to state, and
to defend, what I conceive to be the true principles of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>the Constitution under which we are here assembled.
I might well have desired that so weighty a task
should have fallen into other and abler hands.
I could have wished that it should have
been executed by those whose character and
experience give weight and influence to their opinions,
such as cannot possibly belong to mine.  But, Sir, I
have met the occasion, not sought it; and I shall proceed
to state my own sentiments, without challenging
for them any particular regard; with studied plainness,
and as much precision as possible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">May State
legislatures
arrest national
laws?</div>

<p>I understand the honorable gentleman from South
Carolina to maintain that it is a right of the
State legislatures to interfere, whenever, in
their judgment, this government transcends
its constitutional limits, and to arrest the operation of
its laws.</p>

<p>I understand him to maintain this right, as a right
existing <i>under</i> the Constitution, not as a right to overthrow
it on the ground of extreme necessity, such as
would justify violent revolution.</p>

<p>I understand him to maintain an authority, on the
part of the States, thus to interfere, for the purpose of
correcting the exercise of power by the general government,
of checking it, and of compelling it to conform to
their opinion of the extent of its powers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Are the
States the
final judges
of the acts
of the general
government?</div>

<p>I understand him to maintain, that the ultimate power
of judging of the constitutional extent of its
own authority is not lodged exclusively in
the general government, or any branch of it;
but that, on the contrary, the States may
lawfully decide for themselves, and each State
for itself, whether, in a given case, the act of the general
government transcends its power.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>I understand him to insist that if the exigency of
the case, in the opinion of any State government, require
it, such State government may, by its own sovereign
authority, annul an act of the general government
which it deems plainly and palpably unconstitutional.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The South
Carolina
doctrine.</div>

<p>This is the sum of what I understand from him to be
the South Carolina doctrine, and the doctrine which he
maintains. I propose to consider it, and compare
it with the Constitution. Allow me to
say, as a preliminary remark, that I call this
the South Carolina doctrine only because the gentleman
himself has so denominated it. I do not feel at liberty
to say that South Carolina, as a State, has ever advanced
these sentiments. I hope she has not, and never may.
That a great majority of her people are opposed to the
tariff laws, is doubtless true. That a majority, somewhat
less than that just mentioned, conscientiously believe
these laws unconstitutional, may probably also be
true. But that any majority holds to the right of direct
State interference at State discretion, the right of nullifying
acts of Congress by acts of State legislation, is
more than I know, and what I shall be slow to believe.</p>

<p>That there are individuals besides the honorable gentleman
who do maintain these opinions is quite certain.
I recollect the recent expression of a sentiment which
circumstances attending its utterance and publication
justify us in supposing was not unpremeditated: &ldquo;The
sovereignty of the State,&mdash;never to be controlled, construed,
or decided on, but by her own feelings of honorable
justice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[Mr. Hayne here rose and said that for the purpose
of being clearly understood, he would state that his proposition
was in the words of the Virginia resolution, as
follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That this assembly doth explicitly and peremptorily
declare, that it views the powers of the Federal government
as resulting from the compact to which the States
are parties, as limited by the plain sense and intention
of the instrument constituting that compact, as no farther
valid than they are authorized by the grants enumerated
in that compact; and that, in case of a deliberate,
palpable, and dangerous exercise of other powers not
granted by the said compact, the States who are parties
thereto have the right, and are in duty bound, to interpose,
for arresting the progress of the evil, and for
maintaining within their respective limits the authorities,
rights, and liberties appertaining to them.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Webster resumed:&mdash;]</p>

<div class="sidenote">Webster
admits the
right of
revolution.</div>

<p>I am quite aware, Mr. President, of the existence of
the resolution which the gentleman read, and has now
repeated, and that he relies on it as his authority.
I know the source, too, from which
it is understood to have proceeded. I need
not say that I have much respect for the constitutional
opinions of Mr. Madison; they would weigh greatly
with me always. But before the authority of his opinion
be vouched for the gentleman&rsquo;s proposition, it will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
proper to consider what is the fair interpretation of that
resolution, to which Mr. Madison is understood to have
given his sanction. As the gentleman construes it, it is
an authority for him. Possibly he may not have
adopted the right construction. That resolution declares
that <i>in the case of the dangerous exercise of powers not
granted by the general government, the States may interpose
to arrest the progress of the evil</i>. But how interpose,
and what does this declaration purport? Does it mean
no more than that there may be extreme cases, in which
the people, in any mode of assembling, may resist usurpation,
and relieve themselves from a tyrannical government?
No one will deny this. Such resistance is not
only acknowledged to be just in America, but in England
also Blackstone admits as much, in the theory, and
practice, too, of the English constitution. We, Sir, who
oppose the Carolina doctrine, do not deny that the
people may, if they choose, throw off any government
when it becomes oppressive and intolerable, and erect a
better in its stead. We all know that civil institutions
are established for the public benefit, and that when
they cease to answer the ends of their existence they
may be changed. But I do not understand the doctrine
now contended for to be that which, for the sake of
distinction, we may call the right of revolution. I
understand the gentleman to maintain that without
revolution, without civil commotion, without rebellion,
a remedy for supposed abuse and transgression of the
powers of the general government lies in a direct appeal
to the interference of the State governments.</p>

<p>[Mr. Hayne here rose and said that he did not contend
for the mere right of revolution, but for the
right of constitutional resistance. What he maintained
was, that in case of a plain, palpable violation of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>Constitution by the general government, a State may
interpose; and that this interposition is constitutional.</p>

<p>Mr. Webster resumed:&mdash;]</p>

<div class="sidenote">No middle
course between
revolution
and
submission
to constitutional
laws.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A concise
statement of
Webster&rsquo;s
whole
argument.</div>

<p>So, Sir, I understood the gentleman, and am happy to
find that I did not misunderstand him. What he contends
for is that it is constitutional to interrupt the
administration of the Constitution itself, in the hands of
those who are chosen and sworn to administer it, by the
direct interference, in form of law, of the States, in virtue
of their sovereign capacity. The inherent right in the
people to reform their government I do not deny; and
they have another right, and that is to resist unconstitutional
laws, without overturning the government. It is
no doctrine of mine that unconstitutional laws bind the
people. The great question is, Whose prerogative is it
to decide on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality
of the laws? On that the main debate hinges. The
proposition that, in case of a supposed violation of the
Constitution by Congress, the States have a constitutional
right to interfere and annul the law of Congress,
is the proposition of the gentleman. I do not admit it.
If the gentleman had intended no more than to assert
the right of revolution for justifiable cause, he would
have said only what all agree to. But I cannot conceive
that there can be a middle course, between
submission to the laws, when regularly
pronounced constitutional, on the one hand,
and open resistance, which is revolution or rebellion,
on the other. I say the right of a
State to annul a law of Congress cannot be maintained,
but on the ground of the inalienable right of man to resist
oppression; that is to say, upon the ground of revolution.
I admit that there is an ultimate violent remedy,
above the Constitution and in defiance of the
Consti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>tution, which may be resorted to when a revolution is
to be justified. But I do not admit that, under the
Constitution and in conformity with it, there
is any mode in which a State government, as
a member of the Union, can interfere and
stop the progress of the general government,
by force of her own laws, under any circumstances
whatever.</p>

<p>This leads us to inquire into the origin of this government
and the source of its power. Whose agent is
it?  Is it the creature of the State legislatures,
or the creature of the people? If the
government of the United States be the agent
of the State governments, then they may control
it, provided they can agree in the manner
of controlling it; if it be the agent of the people, then
the people alone can control it, restrain it, modify, or
reform it. It is observable enough that the doctrine
for which the honorable gentleman contends leads him
to the necessity of maintaining, not only that this general
government is the creature of the States, but that
it is the creature of each of the States severally, so that
each may assert the power for itself of determining
whether it acts within the limits of its authority.
It is the servant of four-and-twenty
masters, of different wills and different purposes, and yet
bound to obey all. This absurdity (for it seems no less)
arises from a misconception as to the origin
of this government and its true character.
It is, Sir, the people&rsquo;s Constitution, the people&rsquo;s
government, made for the people, made
by the people, and answerable to the people.
The people of the United States have declared that
this Constitution shall be the supreme law. We must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>either admit the proposition, or dispute their authority.
The States are, unquestionably, sovereign, so far as their
sovereignty is not affected by this supreme law. But
the State legislatures, as political bodies, however sovereign,
are yet not sovereign over the people. So far as
the people have given power to the general government,
so far the grant is unquestionably good, and the government
holds of the people, and not of the State governments.
We are all agents of the same
supreme power, the people.  The general
government and the State governments derive
their authority from the same source.
Neither can, in relation to the other, be called
primary, though one is definite and restricted,
and the other general and residuary. The
national government possesses those powers which it
can be shown the people have conferred on it, and no
more. All the rest belongs to the State governments,
or to the people themselves. So far as the people have
restrained State sovereignty, by the expression of their
will, in the Constitution of the United States, so far, it
must be admitted, State sovereignty is effectually controlled.
I do not contend that it is, or ought to be,
controlled farther. The sentiment to which I have referred
propounds that State sovereignty is only to be
controlled by its own &ldquo;feeling of justice&rdquo;; that is to
say, it is not to be controlled at all, for one who is to
follow his own feelings is under no legal control. Now,
however men may think this ought to be, the fact is,
that the people of the United States have chosen to impose
control on State sovereignties. There are those,
doubtless, who wish they had been left without restraint;
but the Constitution has ordered the matter
differently. To make war, for instance, is an exercise
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>of sovereignty; but the Constitution declares that no
State shall make war.  To coin money is another exercise
of sovereign power; but no State is at liberty to
coin money. Again, the Constitution says that no
sovereign State shall be so sovereign as to make a treaty.
These prohibitions, it must be confessed, are a control
on the State sovereignty of South Carolina,
as as well as of the other States, which does
not arise &ldquo;from her own feelings of honorable
justice.&rdquo; The opinion referred to, therefore,
is in defiance of the plainest provisions of the
Constitution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The &ldquo;sovereign&rdquo;
States.</div>

<p>There are other proceedings of public bodies which
have already been alluded to, and to which I refer again
for the purpose of ascertaining more fully what is the
length and breadth of that doctrine, denominated the
Carolina doctrine, which the honorable member has now
stood up on this floor to maintain. In one of them I
find it resolved, that &ldquo;the tariff of 1828, and every
other tariff designed to promote one branch of industry
at the expense of others, is contrary to the meaning and
intention of the Federal compact; and such a dangerous,
palpable, and deliberate usurpation of power, by a determined
majority, wielding the general government beyond
the limits of its delegated powers, as calls
upon the States which compose the suffering
minority, in their sovereign capacity, to exercise
the powers which, as sovereigns, necessarily devolve
upon them, when their compact is violated.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Are protective
tariffs
unconstitutional
usurpations?</div>

<p>Observe, Sir, that this resolution holds the tariff of
1828, and every other tariff designed to promote one
branch of industry at the expense of another, to be such
a dangerous, palpable, and deliberate usurpation of power,
as calls upon the States, in their sovereign capacity, to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>interfere by their own authority. This denunciation,
Mr. President, you will please to observe, includes our
old tariff of 1816, as well as all others; because
that was established to promote the
interest of the manufacturers of cotton, to the
manifest and admitted injury of the Calcutta
cotton trade.  Observe, again, that all the qualifications
are here rehearsed and charged upon the tariff, which
are necessary to bring the case within the gentleman&rsquo;s
proposition. The tariff is a usurpation; it is a dangerous
usurpation; it is a palpable usurpation; it is a deliberate
usurpation. It is such a usurpation, therefore, as
calls upon the States to exercise their right of interference.
Here is a case, then, within the gentleman&rsquo;s principles,
and all his qualifications of his principles. It is
a case for action. The Constitution is plainly, dangerously,
palpably, and deliberately violated; and the States
must interpose their own authority to arrest the law.
Let us suppose the State of South Carolina to express
this same opinion, by the voice of her legislature. That
would be very imposing; but what then? Is the voice
of one State conclusive? It so happens that, at the very
moment when South Carolina resolves that the tariff
laws are unconstitutional, Pennsylvania and Kentucky
resolve exactly the reverse. <i>They</i> hold those laws to be
both highly proper and strictly constitutional. And now,
Sir, how does the honorable member propose to deal with
this case? How does he relieve us from this difficulty,
upon any principle of his? His construction gets us
into it; how does he propose to get us out?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nullification
would
make uniform
laws
impossible.</div>

<p>In Carolina, the tariff is a palpable, deliberate usurpation;
Carolina, therefore, may nullify it, and refuse to
pay the duties. In Pennsylvania, it is both clearly
constitutional and highly expedient; and there the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>duties are to be paid. And yet we live under a government
of uniform laws, and under a Constitution
too, which contains an express
provision, as it happens, that all duties shall
be equal in all the States. Does not this
approach absurdity?</p>

<p>If there be no power to settle such questions, independent
of either of the States, is not the whole Union
a rope of sand? Are we not thrown back again, precisely,
upon the old Confederation?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Union,
with nullification,
a
mere connection
during
pleasure.</div>

<p>It is too plain to be argued. Four-and-twenty interpreters
of constitutional law, each with a power to decide
for itself, and none with authority to bind
anybody else, and this constitutional law the
only bond of their union! What is such a
state of things but a mere connection during
pleasure, or, to use the phraseology of the
times, <i>during feeling</i>? And that feeling, too, not the
feeling of the people, who established the Constitution,
but the feeling of the State governments!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">New England
rejects
the South
Carolina
doctrine.</div>

<p>The gentleman has found no case, he can find none,
to support his own opinions by New England authority.
New England has studied the Constitution in other
schools and under other teachers. She looks upon it
with other regards, and deems more highly and reverently
both of its just authority and its utility and excellence.
The history of her legislative proceedings may
be traced. The ephemeral effusions of temporary bodies,
called together by the excitement of the occasion,
may be hunted up; they have been hunted up. The
opinions and votes of her public men, in and out of Congress,
may be explored. It will all be in vain. The
Carolina doctrine can derive from her neither
counte<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>nance nor support. She rejects it now; she always did
reject it; and till she loses her senses, she always will
reject it. The honorable member has referred
to expressions on the subject of the
embargo law, made in this place, by an honorable
and venerable gentleman,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> now favoring
us with his presence. He quotes that distinguished Senator
as saying that, in his judgment, the embargo law
was unconstitutional, and that therefore, in his opinion,
the people were not bound to obey it. That, Sir, is
perfectly constitutional language. An unconstitutional
law is not binding; <i>but then it does not rest with a resolution
or a law of a State legislature to decide whether
an act of Congress be or be not constitutional</i>. An
unconstitutional act of Congress would not bind the
people of this District, although they have no legislature
to interfere in their behalf;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and, on the other hand,
a constitutional law of Congress does bind the citizens
of every State, although all their legislatures should
undertake to annul it by act or resolution. The venerable
Connecticut Senator is a constitutional lawyer, of
sound principles and enlarged knowledge; a statesman
practised and experienced, bred in the company of Washington,
and holding just views upon the nature of our
governments. He believed the embargo unconstitutional,
and so did others; but what then? Who did
he suppose was to decide that question? The State
legislatures? Certainly not. No such sentiment ever
escaped his lips.</p>

<p>Let us follow up, Sir, this New England opposition
to the embargo laws; let us trace it, till we discern the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
principle which controlled and governed New England
throughout the whole course of that opposition. We
shall then see what similarity there is between the New
England school of constitutional opinions and this
modern Carolina school. The gentleman, I think, read
a petition from some single individual addressed to the
legislature of Massachusetts, asserting the Carolina doctrine,
that is, the right of State interference to arrest
the laws of the Union. The fate of that petition shows
the sentiment of the legislature. It met no favor. The
opinions of Massachusetts were very different. They
had been expressed in 1798, in answer to the resolutions
of Virginia, and she did not depart from them, nor bend
them to the times. Misgoverned, wronged, oppressed,
as she felt herself to be, she still held fast her integrity
to the Union. The gentleman may find in her proceedings
much evidence of dissatisfaction with the measures
of government, and great and deep dislike to the embargo;
all this makes the case so much the stronger for
her; for, notwithstanding all this dissatisfaction and
dislike, she still claimed no right to sever the bonds of
the Union. There was heat, and there was anger in her
political feeling. Be it so; but neither her heat nor her
anger betrayed her into infidelity to the government.
The gentleman labors to prove that she disliked the
embargo<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> as much as South Carolina dislikes the tariff,
and expressed her dislike as strongly. Be it so; but
did she propose the Carolina remedy? did she threaten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
to interfere, by State authority, to annul the laws of
the Union? That is the question for the gentleman&rsquo;s
consideration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New England
attitude
toward the
embargo
of 1807.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The government
has
power of
deciding
ultimately
on the just
extent of
its own
authority.</div>

<p>No doubt, Sir, a great majority of the people of New
England conscientiously believed the embargo law of
1807 unconstitutional; as conscientiously, certainly,
as the people of South Carolina
hold that opinion of the tariff. They reasoned
thus: Congress has power to regulate
commerce; but here is a law, they said, stopping all
commerce, and stopping it indefinitely. The law is
perpetual; that is, it is not limited in point of time,
and must of course continue until it shall be repealed
by some other law. It is as perpetual, therefore, as
the law against treason or murder. Now, is this regulating
commerce, or destroying it? Is it guiding,
controlling, giving the rule to commerce, as a subsisting
thing, or is it putting an end to it altogether?
Nothing is more certain than that a majority in New
England deemed this law a violation of the Constitution.
The very case required by the gentleman to
justify State interference had then arisen. Massachusetts
believed this law to be &ldquo;a deliberate, palpable, and
dangerous exercise of a power not granted by the Constitution.&rdquo;
Deliberate it was, for it was long continued;
palpable she thought it, as no words in the Constitution
gave the power, and only a construction, in her opinion
most violent, raised it; dangerous it was, since it threatened
utter ruin to her most important interests. Here,
then, was a Carolina case. How did Massachusetts deal
with it? It was, as she thought, a plain, manifest, palpable
violation of the Constitution, and it brought ruin
to her doors. Thousands of families, and hundreds of
thousands of individuals, were beggared by it. While
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>she saw and felt all this, she saw and felt also, that, as a
measure of national policy, it was perfectly futile; that
the country was no way benefited by that which caused
so much individual distress; that it was efficient only
for the production of evil, and all that evil inflicted on
ourselves. In such a case, under such circumstances,
how did Massachusetts demean herself? Sir, she remonstrated,
she memorialized, she addressed herself to
the general government, not exactly &ldquo;with the concentrated
energy of passion,&rdquo; but with her own strong
sense, and the energy of sober conviction. But she did
not interpose the arm of her own power to arrest the
law, and break the embargo. Far from it. Her principles
bound her to two things; and she followed her
principles, lead where they might. First, to submit to
every constitutional law of Congress; and secondly, if
the constitutional validity of the law be doubted, to
refer that question to the decision of the proper tribunals.
The first principle is vain and ineffectual without
the second. A majority of us in New England believed
the embargo law unconstitutional; but the great question
was, and always will be in such cases, Who is to
decide this? Who is to judge between the people and
the government?  And, Sir, it is quite plain that the
Constitution of the United States confers on
the government itself, to be exercised by its
appropriate department, and under its own
responsibility to the people, this power of deciding
ultimately and conclusively upon the
just extent of its own authority. If this had
not been done, we should not have advanced a single
step beyond the old Confederation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The vexed
question of
the tariff.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The laws of
the Union
beyond the
control of
the States.</div>

<p>Sir, the human mind is so constituted that the merits
of both sides of a controversy appear very clear, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>very palpable, to those who respectively espouse them;
and both sides usually grow clearer as the controversy
advances.  South Carolina sees unconstitutionality
in the tariff; she sees oppression
there also, and she sees danger. Pennsylvania,
with a vision not less sharp, looks at the same tariff,
and sees no such thing in it; she sees it all constitutional,
all useful, all safe. The faith of South Carolina
is strengthened by opposition, and she now not only
sees, but <i>resolves</i>, that the tariff is palpably unconstitutional,
oppressive, and dangerous; but Pennsylvania,
not to be behind her neighbors, and equally willing to
strengthen her own faith by a confident asseveration,
<i>resolves</i>, also, and gives to every warm affirmative of
South Carolina, a plain, downright, Pennsylvania negative.
South Carolina, to show the strength and unity
of her opinion, brings her assembly to a unanimity,
within seven voices; Pennsylvania, not to be outdone in
this respect any more than in others, reduces her dissentient
fraction to a single vote. Now, Sir, again I
ask the gentleman, What is to be done? Are these
States both right? Is he bound to consider them both
right? If not, which is in the wrong? or rather, which
has the best right to decide? And if he, and if I, are
not to know what the Constitution means, and what it
is, till those two State legislatures, and the twenty-two
others, shall agree in its construction, what have we
sworn to, when we have sworn to maintain it? I was
forcibly struck, Sir, with one reflection, as the gentleman
went on in his speech. He quoted Mr. Madison&rsquo;s
resolutions, to prove that a State may interfere, in a case
of deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise of a
power not granted. The honorable member supposes
the tariff law to be such an exercise of power; and that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>consequently a case has arisen in which the State may,
if it see fit, interfere by its own law. Now, it so happens,
nevertheless, that Mr. Madison deems this same
tariff law quite constitutional. Instead of a clear and
palpable violation, it is, in his judgment, no violation at
all. So that, while they use his authority for a hypothetical
case, they reject it in the very case before them.
All this, Sir, shows the inherent futility, I had almost
used a stronger word, of conceding this power of interference
to the State, and then attempting to secure it
from abuse by imposing qualifications of which the
States themselves are to judge. One of two
things is true: either the laws of the Union
are beyond the discretion and beyond the
control of the States; or else we have no
constitution of general government, and are thrust back
again to the days of the Confederation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I must now beg to ask, Sir, Whence is this supposed
right of the States derived? Where do they find the
power to interfere with the laws of the Union? Sir,
the opinion which the honorable gentleman maintains is
a notion founded in a total misapprehension, in my
judgment, of the origin of this government, and of the
foundation on which it stands. I hold it to be a popular
government, erected by the people; those who administer
it responsible to the people; and itself capable of
being amended and modified, just as the people may
choose it should be. It is as popular, just as truly
emanating from the people, as the State governments.
It is created for one purpose; the State governments
for another. It has its own powers; they have theirs.
There is no more authority with them to arrest the
operation of a law of Congress, than with Congress to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
arrest the operation of their laws. We are here to
administer a Constitution emanating immediately from
the people, and trusted by them to our administration.
It is not the creature of the State governments. It is
of no moment to the argument, that certain acts of the
State legislatures are necessary to fill our seats in this
body. That is not one of their original State powers,
a part of the sovereignty of the State. It is a duty
which the people, by the Constitution itself, have imposed
on the State legislatures; and which they might have
left to be performed elsewhere, if they had seen fit. So
they have left the choice of President with electors;
but all this does not affect the proposition that this
whole government, President, Senate, and House of
Representatives, is a popular government. It leaves
it still all its popular character. The governor of a
State (in some of the States) is chosen, not directly by
the people, but by those who are chosen by the people,
for the purpose of performing, among other duties, that
of electing a governor. Is the government of the State,
on that account, not a popular government? This
government, Sir, is the independent offspring of the
popular will. It is not the creature of State legislatures;
nay, more, if the whole truth must be told, the people
brought it into existence, established it, and have
hitherto supported it, for the very purpose, amongst
others, of imposing certain salutary restraints on State
sovereignties. The States cannot now make war; they
cannot contract alliances; they cannot make, each for
itself, separate regulations of commerce; they cannot
lay imposts; they cannot coin money. If this Constitution,
Sir, be the creature of State legislatures, it
must be admitted that it has obtained a strange control
over the volitions of its creators.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The failure

<p>The people, then, Sir, erected this government.
They gave it a Constitution, and in that Constitution
they have enumerated the powers which they
bestow on it. They have made it a limited
government. They have defined its authority.
They have restrained it to the exercise of such powers
as are granted; and all others, they declare, are reserved
to the States or the people. But, Sir, they
have not stopped here. If they had, they
would have accomplished but half their work.
No definition can be so clear as to avoid possibility of
doubt; no limitation so precise as to exclude all uncertainty.
Who, then, shall construe this grant of the
people? Who shall interpret their will, where it may
be supposed they have left it doubtful? With whom
do they repose this ultimate right of deciding on the
powers of the government? Sir, they have settled all
this in the fullest manner. They have left it with the
government itself, in its appropriate branches.
Sir, the very chief end, the main design, for
which the whole Constitution was framed
and adopted, was to establish a government
that should not be obliged to act through
State agency, or depend on State opinion
and State discretion. The people had had quite
enough of that kind of government under the Confederation.
Under that system, the legal action, the
application of law to individuals, belonged
exclusively to the States. Congress could
only recommend; their acts were not of
binding force till the States had adopted
and sanctioned them. Are we in that condition
still? Are we yet at the mercy of State discretion
and State construction? Sir, if we are, then vain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
will be our attempt to maintain the Constitution under
which we sit.</p>

<p>But, Sir, the people have wisely provided, in the
Constitution itself, a proper, suitable mode and tribunal
for settling questions of constitutional law. There are
in the Constitution grants of powers to Congress, and
restrictions on these powers. There are, also, prohibitions
on the States. Some authority must, therefore,
necessarily exist, having the ultimate jurisdiction to fix
and ascertain the interpretation of these grants, restrictions,
and prohibitions. The Constitution has itself
pointed out, ordained, and established that authority.
How has it accomplished this great and essential end?
By declaring, Sir, that &ldquo;<i>the Constitution, and the laws of
the United States, made in pursuance thereof, shall be the
supreme law of the land, any thing in the constitution or
laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
supremacy
of the Constitution.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The final
decision of
the Supreme
Court.</div>

<p>This, Sir, was the first great step. By this the supremacy
of the Constitution and laws of the United States
is declared. The people so will it. No State
law is to be valid which comes in conflict
with the Constitution, or any law of the
United States passed in pursuance of it. But who shall
decide this question of interference? To whom lies the
last appeal? This, Sir, the Constitution itself decides
also, by declaring, &ldquo;<i>that the judicial power shall extend to
all cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the
United States</i>.&rdquo; These two provisions cover the whole
ground. They are, in truth, the keystone of the arch!
With these it is a government; without them it is a
confederation. In pursuance of these clear and express
provisions, Congress established, at its very first session,
in the judicial act, a mode for carrying them into full
effect, and for bringing all questions of constitutional
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>power to the final decision of the Supreme Court. It
then, Sir, became a government.  It then had the means
of self-protection; and but for this, it would,
in all probability, have been now among
things which are past. Having constituted
the government, and declared its powers, the people have
further said, that, since somebody must decide on the
extent of these powers, the government shall itself decide;
subject, always, like other popular governments,
to its responsibility to the people. And now, Sir, I repeat,
how it is that a State legislature acquires any
power to interfere? Who, or what, gives them the
right to say to the people, &ldquo;We, who are your agents
and servants for one purpose, will undertake to decide
that your other agents and servants, appointed by
you for another purpose, have transcended the authority
you gave them!&rdquo; The reply would be, I
think, not impertinent, &ldquo;Who made you a judge over
another&rsquo;s servants? To their own masters they stand
or fall.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Revolution
a law to
itself.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The people
have reposed
power
in the general
government.</div>

<p>Sir, I deny this power of State legislatures altogether.
It cannot stand the test of examination. Gentlemen
may say that in an extreme case a State government
might protect the people from intolerable oppression.
Sir, in such a case the people might
protect themselves without the aid of the
State governments. Such a case warrants revolution.
It must make, when it comes, a law for itself.  A nullifying
act of a State legislature cannot alter
the case, nor make resistance any more lawful.
In maintaining these sentiments, Sir, I
am but asserting the rights of the people.
I state what they have declared, and insist on their right
to declare it. They have chosen to repose this power in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the general government, and I think it my duty to support
it, like other constitutional powers.</p>

<p>For myself, Sir, I do not admit the competency of
South Carolina, or any other State, to prescribe my constitutional
duty; or to settle, between me and the people,
the validity of laws of Congress for which I have
voted. I decline her umpirage. I have not sworn to
support the Constitution according to her construction
of its clauses. I have not stipulated, by my oath of
office or otherwise, to come under any responsibility,
except to the people, and those whom they have appointed
to pass upon the question, whether laws, supported
by my votes, conform to the Constitution of the
country. And, Sir, if we look to the general nature of
the case, could anything have been more preposterous
than to make a government for the whole Union, and
yet leave its powers subject, not to one interpretation,
but to thirteen or twenty-four interpretations? Instead
of one tribunal, established by all, responsible to all,
with power to decide for all, shall constitutional questions
be left to four-and-twenty popular bodies, each at
liberty to decide for itself, and none bound to respect
the decisions of others,&mdash;and each at liberty, too, to give
a new construction on every new election of its own
members? Would anything, with such a principle in it,
or rather with such a destitution of all principle, be fit
to be called a government? No, Sir. It should not be
denominated a Constitution. It should be called, rather,
a collection of topics for everlasting controversy; heads
of debate for a disputatious people. It would not be a
government. It would not be adequate to any practical
good, or fit for any country to live under.</p>

<p>To avoid all possibility of being misunderstood, allow
me to repeat again, in the fullest manner, that I claim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
no powers for the government by forced or unfair construction.
I admit that it is a government of strictly
limited powers; of enumerated, specified, and particularized
powers; and that whatsoever is not granted, is
withheld. But notwithstanding all this, and however
the grant of powers may be expressed, its limit and extent
may yet, in some cases, admit of doubt; and
the general government would be good for nothing,
it would be incapable of long existing, if some mode
had not been provided in which those doubts, as they
should arise, might be peaceably, but authoritatively,
solved.</p>

<p>And now, Mr. President, let me run the honorable
gentleman&rsquo;s doctrine a little into its practical application.
Let us look at his probable <i>modus operandi</i>. If
a thing can be done, an ingenious man can tell how it is
to be done, and I wish to be informed how this State interference
is to be put in practice, without violence,
bloodshed, and rebellion.</p>

<p>We will take the existing case of the tariff law.
South Carolina is said to have made up her opinion
upon it. If we do not repeal it, (as we probably shall
not,) she will then apply to the case the remedy of her
doctrine. She will, we must suppose, pass a law of her
legislature, declaring the several acts of Congress usually
called the tariff laws null and void, so far as they respect
South Carolina, or the citizens thereof. So far, all is a
paper transaction, and easy enough. But the collector
at Charleston is collecting the duties imposed by these
tariff laws. He, therefore, must be stopped. The collector
will seize the goods if the tariff duties are not
paid. The State authorities will undertake their rescue,
the marshal, with his posse, will come to the collector&rsquo;s
aid, and here the contest begins. The militia of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
State will be called out to sustain the Nullifying Act.
They will march, Sir, under a very gallant leader; for I
believe the honorable member himself commands the
militia of that part of the State. He will raise the
Nullifying Act on his standard, and spread it out as
his banner! It will have a preamble, setting forth that
the tariff laws are palpable, deliberate, and dangerous

this banner flying, to the custom-house in Charleston,</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">&ldquo;All the while</span><br />
Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">Arrived at the custom-house, he will tell the collector
that he must collect no more duties under any of the
tariff laws. This he will be somewhat puzzled to say,
by the way, with a grave countenance, considering what
hand South Carolina herself had in that of 1816. But,
Sir, the collector would not probably desist, at his
bidding. He would show him the law of Congress,
the treasury instruction, and his own oath of office.
He would say, he should perform his duty, come what
come might.</p>

<p>Here would ensue a pause; for they say that a certain
stillness precedes the tempest. The trumpeter would
hold his breath awhile, and before all this military array
should fall on the custom-house, collector, clerks, and
all, it is very probable some of those composing it
would request of their gallant commander-in-chief to be
informed a little upon the point of law; for they have,
doubtless, a just respect for his opinions as a lawyer,
as well as for his bravery as a soldier. They know he
has read Blackstone<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and the Constitution, as well as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
Turenne<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and Vauban.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> They would ask him, therefore,
something concerning their rights in this matter.
They would inquire whether it was not somewhat dangerous
to resist a law of the United States. What would
be the nature of their offence, they would wish to learn,
if they, by military force and array, resisted the execution
in Carolina of a law of the United States, and it
should turn out, after all, that the law <i>was constitutional?</i>
He would answer, of course, Treason. No lawyer could
give any other answer. John Fries,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> he would tell them,
had learned that, some years ago. How, then, they
would ask, do you propose to defend us? We are not
afraid of bullets, but treason has a way of taking people
off that we do not much relish. How do you propose
to defend us? &ldquo;Look at my floating banner,&rdquo; he would
reply; &ldquo;see there the <i>nullifying law</i>!&rdquo; Is it your
opinion, gallant commander, they would then say, that,
if we should be indicted for treason, that same floating
banner of yours would make a good plea in bar?
&ldquo;South Carolina is a sovereign State,&rdquo; he would reply.
That is true; but would the judge admit our plea?
&ldquo;These tariff laws,&rdquo; he would repeat, &ldquo;are unconstitu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>tional,
palpably, deliberately, dangerously.&rdquo; That may
all be so; but if the tribunal should not happen to be
of that opinion, shall we swing for it? We are ready to
die for our country, but it is rather an awkward business,
this dying without touching the ground! After all, that
is a sort of hemp tax worse than any part of the tariff.</p>

<p>Mr. President, the honorable gentleman would be in
a dilemma, like that of another great general. He
would have a knot before him which he could not untie.
He must cut it with his sword. He must say to his
followers, &ldquo;Defend yourselves with your bayonets;&rdquo;
and this is war,&mdash;civil war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nullification
leads to
disunion.</div>

<p>Direct collision, therefore, between force and force, is
the unavoidable result of that remedy for the revision
of unconstitutional laws which the gentleman contends
for. It must happen in the very first case to which it
is applied. Is not this the plain result? To resist by
force the execution of a law, generally, is treason. Can
the courts of the United States take notice of the indulgence
of a State to commit treason? The common
saying that a State cannot commit treason herself, is
nothing to the purpose. Can she authorize others to
do it? If John Fries had produced an act of Pennsylvania,
annulling the law of Congress, would it have
helped his case? Talk about it as we will, these doctrines
go the length of revolution. They are incompatible
with any peaceable administration of
the government. They lead directly to disunion
and civil commotion; and therefore it
is, that at their commencement, when they are first
found to be maintained by respectable men, and in a
tangible form, I enter my public protest against them all.</p>

<p>The honorable gentleman argues, that, if this government
be the sole judge of the extent of its own powers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
whether that right of judging be in Congress or the
Supreme Court, it equally subverts State sovereignty.
This the gentleman sees, or thinks he sees, although he
cannot perceive how the right of judging in this matter,
if left to the exercise of State legislatures, has any
tendency to subvert the government of the Union.
The gentleman&rsquo;s opinion may be that the right <i>ought not</i>
to have been lodged with the general government; he
may like better such a constitution as we should have
under the right of State interference; but I ask him
to meet me on the plain matter of fact. I ask him to
meet me on the Constitution itself. I ask him if the
power is not found there, clearly and visibly found
there?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Constitution
alterable
by the
people, not
by the States.</div>

<p>But, Sir, what is this danger, and what are the grounds
of it? Let it be remembered that the Constitution of
the United States is not unalterable. It is to
continue in its present form no longer than
the people who established it shall choose
to continue it. If they shall become convinced
that they have made an injudicious or inexpedient
partition and distribution of power between the State
governments and the general government, they can alter
that distribution at will.</p>

<p>But, Sir, although there are fears, there are hopes
also. The people have preserved this, their own chosen
Constitution, for forty years, and have seen their happiness,
prosperity, and renown grow with its growth, and
strengthen with its strength. They are now, generally,
strongly attached to it. Overthrown by direct assault it
cannot be; evaded, undermined, <i>nullified</i>, it will not be,
if we and those who shall succeed us here, as agents and
representatives of the people, shall conscientiously
and vigilantly discharge the two great branches of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
our public trust, faithfully to preserve, and wisely to
administer it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The preservation
of
the Union.</div>

<p>Mr. President, I have thus stated the reasons of my
dissent to the doctrines which have been advanced and
maintained. I am conscious of having detained
you and the Senate much too long. I
was drawn into the debate with no previous
deliberation, such as is suited to the discussion of so
grave and important a subject. But it is a subject of
which my heart is full, and I have not been willing to
suppress the utterance of its spontaneous sentiments. I
cannot, even now, persuade myself to relinquish it,
without expressing once more my deep conviction, that,
since it respects nothing less than the Union of the
States, it is of most vital and essential importance to the
public happiness. I profess, Sir, in my career hitherto,
to have kept steadily in view the prosperity and honor
of the whole country, and the preservation of our Federal
Union. It is to that Union we owe our safety at home,
and our consideration and dignity abroad. It is to that
Union that we are chiefly indebted for whatever makes
us most proud of our country. That Union we reached
only by the discipline of our virtues in the severe school
of adversity. It had its origin in the necessities of disordered
finance, prostrate commerce, and ruined credit.
Under its benign influences, these great interests immediately
awoke, as from the dead, and sprang forth with
newness of life. Every year of its duration has teemed
with fresh proofs of its utility and its blessings; and
although our territory has stretched out wider and
wider, and our population spread farther and farther,
they have not outrun its protection or its benefits. It
has been to us all a copious fountain of national, social,
and personal happiness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Webster&rsquo;s
final
prayer.</div>

<p>I have not allowed myself, Sir, to look beyond the
Union, to see what might lie hidden in the dark recess
behind. I have not coolly weighed the
chances of preserving liberty when the bonds
that unite us together shall be broken asunder.
I have not accustomed myself to hang over the
precipice of disunion, to see whether, with my short
sight, I can fathom the depth of the abyss below; nor
could I regard him as a safe counsellor in the affairs of
this government, whose thoughts should be mainly bent
on considering, not how the Union may be best preserved,
but how tolerable might be the condition of
the people when it should be broken up and destroyed.
While the Union lasts, we have high, exciting, gratifying
prospects spread out before us, for us and our
children. Beyond that I seek not to penetrate the veil.
God grant that, in my day, at least, that curtain may
not rise! God grant that on my vision never may be
opened what lies behind! When my eyes shall be
turned to behold for the last time the sun in heaven,
may I not see him shining on the broken and dishonored
fragments of a once glorious Union; on States dissevered,
discordant, belligerent; on a land rent with
civil feuds, or drenched, it may be, in fraternal blood!
Let their last feeble and lingering glance rather behold
the gorgeous ensign of the republic, now known and
honored throughout the earth, still full high advanced,
its arms and trophies streaming in their original lustre,
not a stripe erased or polluted, nor a single star obscured,
bearing for its motto no such miserable interrogatory
as &ldquo;What is all this worth?&rdquo; nor those other words of
delusion and folly, &ldquo;Liberty first and Union afterwards&rdquo;;
but everywhere, spread all over in characters of living
light, blazing on all its ample folds, as they float over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>

FROM OFFICE</h2>

<p class="center">FROM A SPEECH DELIVERED AT THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN
CONVENTION HELD AT WORCESTER, MASSACHUSETTS,
OCTOBER 12, 1832</p>


<p>The same party selfishness which drives good men out
of office will push bad men in. Political proscription
leads necessarily to the filling of offices with incompetent
persons, and to a consequent mal-execution of
official duties. And in my opinion, Sir, this principle
of claiming a monopoly of office by the right of conquest,
unless the public shall effectually rebuke and restrain
it, will entirely change the character of our government.
It elevates party above country; it forgets the common
weal in the pursuit of personal emolument; it tends
to form, it does form, we see that it has formed, a
political combination, united by no common principles
or opinions among its members, either upon the powers
of the government, or the true policy of the country;
but held together simply as an association, under the
charm of a popular head; seeking to maintain possession
of the government by a vigorous exercise of its patronage;
and for this purpose agitating, and alarming, and
distressing social life by the exercise of a tyrannical party
proscription. Sir, if this course of things cannot be
checked, good men will grow tired of the exercise of
political privileges. They will have nothing to do with
popular elections. They will see that such elections are
but a mere selfish contest for office; and they will abandon
the government to the scramble of the bold, the
daring, and the desperate.</p>

<p class="center">A SPEECH DELIVERED AT A PUBLIC DINNER IN THE
CITY OF WASHINGTON, FEB. 22, 1832, THE CENTENNIAL
ANNIVERSARY OF WASHINGTON&rsquo;S BIRTH</p>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 336px;">

<span class="caption"><i>George Washington.</i></span>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">The power
of the name
of Washington.</div>

<p>We are met to testify our
regard for him whose name
is intimately blended with
whatever belongs most essentially
to the prosperity,
the liberty, the free institutions,
and the renown of
our country.
That name was of power to rally a
nation, in the hour of thick-thronging
public disasters
and calamities; that name
shone, amid the storm of
war, a beacon light, to
cheer and guide the country&rsquo;s friends; it flamed, too,
like a meteor, to repel her foes. That name, in the days
of peace, was a loadstone, attracting to itself
a whole people&rsquo;s confidence, a whole people&rsquo;s
love, and the whole world&rsquo;s respect. That
name, descending with all time, spreading
over the whole earth, and uttered in all the languages
belonging to the tribes and races of men, will forever be
pronounced with affectionate gratitude by every one in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
whose breast there shall arise an aspiration for human
rights and human liberty.</p>

<p>We perform this grateful duty, Gentlemen, at the
expiration of a hundred years from his birth, near the
place, so cherished and beloved by him, where his dust
now reposes, and in the capital which bears his own
immortal name.</p>

<p>All experience evinces that human sentiments are
strongly influenced by associations. The recurrence of
anniversaries, or of longer periods of time, naturally
freshens the recollection, and deepens the impression, of
events with which they are historically connected. Renowned
places, also, have a power to awaken feeling,
which all acknowledge. No American can pass by the
fields of Bunker Hill, Monmouth, and Camden, as if
they were ordinary spots on the earth&rsquo;s surface. Whoever
visits them feels the sentiment of love of country
kindling anew, as if the spirit that belonged to the transactions
which have rendered these places distinguished
still hovered round, with power to move and excite all
who in future time may approach them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Washington&rsquo;s
great
moral
example
to the youth
of America.</div>

<p>But neither of these sources of emotion equals the
power with which great moral examples affect the mind.
When sublime virtues cease to be abstractions,
when they become embodied in human
character, and exemplified in human conduct,
we should be false to our own nature if we
did not indulge in the spontaneous effusions
of our gratitude and our admiration. A true lover of
the virtue of patriotism delights to contemplate its purest
models; and that love of country may be well suspected
which affects to soar so high into the regions of
sentiment as to be lost and absorbed in the abstract feeling,
and becomes too elevated or too refined to glow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
with fervor in the commendation or the love of individual
benefactors. All this is unnatural. It is as if one
should be so enthusiastic a lover of poetry as to care
nothing for Homer or Milton; so passionately attached
to eloquence as to be indifferent to Tully<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and Chatham;
or such a devotee to the arts, in such an ecstasy
with the elements of beauty, proportion, and expression,
as to regard the masterpieces of Raphael and Michael
Angelo with coldness or contempt. We may be assured,
Gentlemen, that he who really loves the thing itself;
loves its finest exhibitions. A true friend of his country
loves her friends and benefactors, and thinks it no
degradation to commend and commemorate them. The
voluntary outpouring of the public feeling, made to-day,
from the north to the south, and from the east to the
west, proves this sentiment to be both just and natural.
In the cities and in the villages, in the public temples
and in the family circles, among all ages and sexes,
gladdened voices to-day bespeak grateful hearts and a
freshened recollection of the virtues of the Father of his
Country. And it will be so, in all time to come, so
long as public virtue is itself an object of regard. The
ingenuous youth of America will hold up to themselves
the bright model of Washington&rsquo;s example, and study
to be what they behold; they will contemplate his character
till all its virtues spread out and display themselves
to their delighted vision; as the earliest
astronomers, the shepherds on the plains of Babylon,
gazed at the stars till they saw them form into clusters
and constellations, overpowering at length the eyes of
the beholders with the united blaze of a thousand
lights.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">THE RESIGNATION OF WASHINGTON</span>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">A wonderful
age and
country.</div>

<p>Gentlemen, we are at a point of a century from the
birth of Washington; and what a century it has been!
During its course, the human mind has
seemed to proceed with a sort of geometric
velocity, accomplishing for human intelligence
and human freedom more than had been done in
fives or tens of centuries preceding. Washington stands
at the commencement of a new era, as well as at the
head of the New World. A century from the birth
of Washington has changed the world. The country of
Washington has been the theatre on which a great part
of that change has been wrought, and Washington himself
a principal agent by which it has been accomplished.
His age and his country are equally full of wonders;
and of both he is the chief.</p>

<p>If the poetical prediction, uttered a few years before
his birth, be true; if indeed it be designed by Providence
that the grandest exhibition of human character
and human affairs shall be made on this theatre of the
Western world; if it be true that,</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;The four first acts already past,<br />
A fifth shall close the drama with the day;<br />
Time&rsquo;s noblest offspring is the last&rdquo;;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a><br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">how could this imposing, swelling, final scene be appropriately
opened, how could its intense interest be adequately
sustained, but by the introduction of just such a
character as our Washington?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The spirit
of human
freedom.</div>

<p>Washington had attained his manhood when that
spark of liberty was struck out in his own country
which has since kindled into a flame and shot its beams
over the earth. In the flow of a century from his birth,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
the world has changed in science, in arts, in the extent
of commerce, in the improvement of navigation, and in
all that relates to the civilization of man.
But it is the spirit of human freedom, the
new elevation of individual man, in his moral,
social, and political character, leading the whole long
train of other improvements, which has most remarkably
distinguished the era. Society, in this century, has not
made its progress, like Chinese skill, by a greater acuteness
of ingenuity in trifles; it has not merely lashed itself
to an increased speed round the old circles of
thought and action; but it has assumed a new character;
it has raised itself from <i>beneath</i> governments to a
participation <i>in</i> governments; it has mixed moral and
political objects with the daily pursuits of individual
men; and, with a freedom and strength before altogether
unknown, it has applied to these objects the
whole power of the human understanding. It has been
the era, in short, when the social principle has triumphed
over the feudal principle; when society has maintained
its rights against military power, and established, on
foundations never hereafter to be shaken, its competency
to govern itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A new governmental
experiment.</div>

<p>It was the extraordinary fortune of Washington, that,
having been intrusted, in revolutionary times, with the
supreme military command, and having fulfilled that
trust with equal renown for wisdom and for valor, he
should be placed at the head of the first government in
which an attempt was to be made on a large scale to
rear the fabric of social order on the basis of a written
constitution and of a pure representative principle. A
government was to be established, without a throne,
without an aristocracy, without castes, orders, or privileges;
and this government, instead of being a democ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>racy
existing and acting within the walls of a single
city, was to be extended over a vast country of different
climates, interests, and habits, and of various communions
of our common Christian faith.
The experiment certainly was entirely new. A
popular government of this extent, it was
evident, could be framed only by carrying into full effect
the principle of representation or of delegated
power; and the world was to see whether society could,
by the strength of this principle, maintain its own peace
and good government, carry forward its own great interests,
and conduct itself to political renown and glory.
By the benignity of Providence, this experiment, so full
of interest to us and to our posterity forever, so full of
interest, indeed, to the world in its present generation
and in all its generations to come, was suffered to commence
under the guidance of Washington. Destined
for this high career, he was fitted for it by wisdom, by
virtue, by patriotism, by discretion, by whatever can
inspire confidence in man toward man. In entering on
the untried scenes, early disappointment and the premature
extinction of all hope of success would have been
certain, had it not been that there did exist throughout
the country, in a most extraordinary degree, an unwavering
trust in him who stood at the helm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The world
interested
in the
experiment.</div>

<p>I remarked, Gentlemen, that the whole world was and
is interested in the result of this experiment. And is it
not so? Do we deceive ourselves, or is it
true that at this moment the career which
this government is running is among the
most attractive objects to the civilized world? Do we
deceive ourselves, or is it true that at this moment that
love of liberty and that understanding of its true principles
which are flying over the whole earth, as on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
wings of all the winds, are really and truly of American
origin?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance
of the
English
Revolution
of 1688.</div>

<p>At the period of the birth of Washington there existed
in Europe no political liberty in large communities,
except in the provinces of Holland, and except that
England herself had set a great example, so
far as it went, by her glorious Revolution of
1688. Everywhere else, despotic power was
predominant, and the feudal or military principle
held the mass of mankind in hopeless bondage.
One-half of Europe was crushed beneath the Bourbon
sceptre, and no conception of political liberty, no hope
even of religious toleration, existed among that nation
which was America&rsquo;s first ally. The king was the state,
the king was the country, the king was all. There was
one king, with power not derived from his people, and
too high to be questioned; and the rest were all subjects,
with no political right but obedience. All above
was intangible power, all below quiet subjection. A recent
occurrence in the French chamber shows us how
public opinion on these subjects is changed. A minister
had spoken of the &ldquo;king&rsquo;s subjects.&rdquo; &ldquo;There are no
subjects,&rdquo; exclaimed hundreds of voices at once, &ldquo;in a
country where the people make the king!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gentlemen, the spirit of human liberty and of free
government, nurtured and grown into strength and
beauty in America, has stretched its course into the
midst of the nations. Like an emanation from Heaven,
it has gone forth, and it will not return void. It must
change, it is fast changing, the face of the earth. Our
great, our high duty is to show, in our own example,
that this spirit is a spirit of health as well as a spirit of
power; that its benignity is as great as its strength;
that its efficiency to secure individual rights, social rela<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>tions,
and moral order, is equal to the irresistible force
with which it prostrates principalities and powers. The
world, at this moment, is regarding us with a willing,
but something of a fearful admiration. Its deep and
awful anxiety is to learn whether free States may be
stable, as well as free; whether popular power may be
trusted, as well as feared; in short, whether wise, regular,
and virtuous self-government is a vision for the
contemplation of theorists, or a truth established, illustrated,
and brought into practice in the country of
Washington.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The United
States a
Western
Sun.</div>

<p>Gentlemen, for the earth which we inhabit, and the
whole circle of the sun, for all the unborn races of mankind,
we seem to hold in our hands, for their weal or
woe, the fate of this experiment. If we fail, who shall
venture the repetition? If our example shall prove to
be one not of encouragement, but of terror, not fit to be
imitated, but fit only to be shunned, where else shall
the world look for free models? If this great
<i>Western Sun</i> be struck out of the firmament,
at what other fountain shall the lamp of liberty
hereafter be lighted? What other orb
shall emit a ray to glimmer, even, on the darkness of the
world?</p>

<p>There is no danger of our overrating or overstating
the important part which we are now acting in human
affairs. It should not flatter our personal self-respect,
but it should reanimate our patriotic virtues, and inspire
us with a deeper and more solemn sense both of our
privileges and of our duties. We cannot wish better
for our country, nor for the world, than that the same
spirit which influenced Washington may influence all
who succeed him; and that the same blessing from
above, which attended his efforts, may also attend theirs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Washington&rsquo;s Farewell Address.</div>

<p>The principles of Washington&rsquo;s administration are
not left doubtful. They are to be found in the
Constitution itself, in the great measures
recommended and approved by him, in his
speeches to Congress, and in that most interesting
paper, his Farewell Address to the people of the
United States. The success of the government under
his administration is the highest proof of the soundness
of these principles. And, after an experience of thirty-five
years, what is there which an enemy could condemn?
What is there which either his friends, or the
friends of the country, could wish to have been otherwise?
I speak, of course, of great measures and leading
principles.</p>

<p>In the first place, all his measures were right in their
intent. He stated the whole basis of his own great
character, when he told the country, in the homely
phrase of the proverb, that honesty is the best policy.
One of the most striking things ever said of him is,
that &ldquo;<i>he changed mankind&rsquo;s ideas of political greatness</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
To commanding talents, and to success, the common
elements of such greatness, he added a disregard of self,
a spotlessness of motive, a steady submission to every
public and private duty, which threw far into the shade
the whole crowd of vulgar great. The object of his
regard was the whole country. No part of it was
enough to fill his enlarged patriotism. His love of
glory, so far as that may be supposed to have influenced
him at all, spurned everything short of general approbation.
It would have been nothing to him that his
partisans or his favorites outnumbered, or outvoted, or
outmanaged, or outclamored, those of other leaders. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
had no favorites; he rejected all partisanship; and, acting
honestly for the universal good, he deserved, what
he has so richly enjoyed, the universal love.</p>

<p>His principle it was to act right, and to trust the
people for support; his principle it was not to follow
the lead of sinister and selfish ends, nor to rely on the
little arts of party delusion to obtain public sanction for
such a course. Born for his country and for the world,
he did not give up to party what was meant for mankind.
The consequence is, that his fame is as durable
as his principles, as lasting as truth and virtue themselves.
While the hundreds whom party excitement,
and temporary circumstances, and casual combinations,
have raised into transient notoriety, sink again, like thin
bubbles, bursting and dissolving into the great ocean,
Washington&rsquo;s fame is like the rock which bounds that
ocean, and at whose feet its billows are destined to
break harmlessly forever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His conduct of America&rsquo;s foreign relations.</div>

<p>The maxims upon which Washington conducted our
foreign relations were few and simple. The first was an
entire and indisputable impartiality towards
foreign States.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> He adhered to this rule
of public conduct, against very strong
inducements to depart from it, and when the
popularity of the moment seemed to favor such a departure.
In the next place, he maintained true dignity
and unsullied honor in all communications with foreign
States. It was among the high duties devolved
upon him to introduce our new government into the
circle of civilized States and powerful nations. Not
arrogant or assuming, with no unbecoming or supercilious
bearing, he yet exacted for it from all others<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
entire and punctilious respect. He demanded, and he
obtained at once, a standing of perfect equality for his
country in the society of nations; nor was there a
prince or potentate of his day, whose personal character
carried with it, into the intercourse of other
States, a greater degree of respect and veneration.</p>

<p>He regarded other nations only as they stood in political
relations to us. With their internal affairs, their
political parties and dissensions, he scrupulously abstained
from all interference; and, on the other hand, he repelled
with spirit all such interference by others with us or
our concerns. His sternest rebuke, the most indignant
measure of his whole administration, was aimed against
such an attempted interference. He felt it as an attempt
to wound the national honor, and resented it accordingly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foreign
influence
a foe of
republican
government.</div>

<p>The reiterated admonitions in his Farewell Address
show his deep fears that foreign influence would insinuate
itself into our counsels through the channels of
domestic dissension, and obtain a sympathy with our
own temporary parties. Against all such dangers he
most earnestly entreats the country to guard itself. He
appeals to its patriotism, to its self-respect, to its own
honor, to every consideration connected with its welfare
and happiness, to resist, at the very beginning, all tendencies
towards such connection of foreign interests
with our own affairs. With a tone of earnestness nowhere
else found, even in his last affectionate farewell
advice to his countrymen, he says, &ldquo;Against
the insidious wiles of foreign influence, (I
conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens,) the
jealousy of a free people ought to be <i>constantly</i>
awake; since history and experience prove that
foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of
republican government.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The advantages
of
American
isolation.</div>

<p>Lastly, on the subject of foreign relations, Washington
never forgot that we had interests peculiar to ourselves.
The primary political concerns of Europe, he
saw, did not affect us. We had nothing to do with her
balance of power, her family compacts, or her successions
to thrones. We were placed in a condition
favorable to neutrality during European wars,
and to the enjoyment of all the great advantages
of that relation. &ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; he asks us, &ldquo;why
forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why
quit our own to stand upon foreign ground? Why,
by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of
Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils
of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or
caprice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed, Gentlemen, Washington&rsquo;s Farewell Address is
full of truths important at all times, and particularly
deserving consideration at the present. With a sagacity
which brought the future before him, and made it like
the present, he saw and pointed out the dangers that
even at this moment most imminently threaten us. I
hardly know how a greater service of that kind could
now be done to the community, than by a renewed and
wide diffusion of that admirable paper, and an earnest
invitation to every man in the country to reperuse and
consider it. Its political maxims are invaluable; its
exhortations to love of country and to brotherly affection
among citizens, touching; and the solemnity with
which it urges the observance of moral duties, and
impresses the power of religious obligation, gives to it
the highest character of truly disinterested, sincere,
parental advice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Washington&rsquo;s
domestic
policy.</div>

<p>The domestic policy of Washington found its pole-star
in the avowed objects of the Constitution itself.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>He sought so to administer that Constitution as to form
a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic
tranquillity, provide for the common defence,
promote the general welfare, and secure the
blessings of liberty. These were objects interesting,
in the highest degree, to the whole country,
and his policy embraced the whole country.</p>

<p>Among his earliest and most important duties was the
organization of the government itself, the choice of his
confidential advisers, and the various appointments to
office. This duty, so important and delicate, when a
whole government was to be organized, and all its offices
for the first time filled, was yet not difficult to him, for
he had no sinister ends to accomplish, no clamorous
partisans to gratify, no pledges to redeem, no object to
be regarded but simply the public good. It was a plain,
straightforward matter, a mere honest choice of good
men for the public service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His first
cabinet.</div>

<p>His own singleness of purpose, his disinterested patriotism,
were evinced by the selection of his first cabinet,
and by the manner in which he filled the seats
of justice, and other places of high trust. He
sought for men fit for offices; not for offices which might
suit men. Above personal considerations, above local
considerations, above party considerations, he felt that
he could only discharge the sacred trust which the
country had placed in his hands, by a diligent inquiry
after real merit, and a conscientious preference of virtue
and talent. The whole country was the field of his
selection. He explored that whole field, looking only
for whatever it contained most worthy and distinguished.
He was, indeed, most successful, and he deserved success
for the purity of his motives, the liberality of his sentiments,
and his enlarged and manly policy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Important
measures of
his administration.</div>

<p>Washington&rsquo;s administration established the national
credit, made provision for the public debt, and for that
patriotic army whose interests and welfare
were always so dear to him; and, by laws wisely
framed, and of admirable effect, raised the
commerce and navigation of the country, almost at once,
from depression and ruin to a state of prosperity. Nor
were his eyes open to these interests alone. He viewed
with equal concern its agriculture and manufactures,
and, so far as they came within the regular exercise of
the powers of this government, they experienced regard
and favor.</p>

<p>It should not be omitted, even in this slight reference
to the general measures and general principles of the
first President, that he saw and felt the full value and
importance of the judicial department of the government.
An upright and able administration of the laws
he held to be alike indispensable to private happiness
and public liberty. The temple of justice, in his opinion,
was a sacred place, and he would profane and pollute it
who should call any to minister in it, not spotless in
character, not incorruptible in integrity, not competent
by talent and learning, not a fit object of unhesitating
trust.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His opinion
of the
dangers of
party spirit.</div>

<p>Among other admonitions, Washington has left us, in
his last communication to his country, an exhortation
against the excesses of party spirit. A fire
not to be quenched, he yet conjures us not to
fan and feed the flame. Undoubtedly, Gentlemen,
it is the greatest danger of our system and of
our time. Undoubtedly, if that system should be overthrown,
it will be the work of excessive party spirit, acting
on the government, which is dangerous enough, or
acting in the government, which is a thousand times<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
more dangerous; for government then becomes nothing
but organized party, and, in the strange vicissitudes of
human affairs, it may come at last, perhaps, to exhibit
the singular paradox of government itself being in opposition
to its own powers, at war with the very elements
of its own existence. Such cases are hopeless. As
men may be protected against murder, but cannot
be guarded against suicide, so government may be
shielded from the assaults of external foes, but nothing
can save it when it chooses to lay violent hands on
itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His love of
the Union.</div>

<p>Finally, Gentlemen, there was in the breast of Washington
one sentiment so deeply felt, so constantly uppermost,
that no proper occasion escaped without
its utterance. From the letter which he
signed in behalf of the Convention when the Constitution
was sent out to the people, to the moment when he
put his hand to that last paper in which he addressed
his countrymen, the Union,&mdash;the Union was the great
object of his thoughts. In that first letter he tells them
that to him and his brethren of the Convention, union
appears to be the greatest interest of every true American;
and in that last paper he conjures them to regard
that unity of government which constitutes them one
people as the very palladium of their prosperity and
safety, and the security of liberty itself. He regarded
the union of these States less as one of our blessings,
than as the great treasure-house which contained them
all. Here, in his judgment, was the great magazine of
all our means of prosperity; here, as he thought, and as
every true American still thinks, are deposited all our
animating prospects, all our solid hopes for future greatness.
He has taught us to maintain this union, not by
seeking to enlarge the powers of the government, on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
one hand, nor by surrendering them, on the other; but
by an administration of them at once firm and moderate,
pursuing objects truly national, and carried on in a
spirit of justice and equity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
American
nation
unique.</div>

<p>The extreme solicitude for the preservation of the
Union, at all times manifested by him, shows not only
the opinion he entertained of its importance,
but his clear perception of those causes
which were likely to spring up to endanger
it, and which, if once they should overthrow the present
system, would leave little hope of any future beneficial
reunion. Of all the presumptions indulged by presumptuous
man, that is one of the rashest which looks
for repeated and favorable opportunities for the deliberate
establishment of a united government over distinct
and widely extended communities. Such a thing has
happened once in human affairs, and but once; the
event stands out as a prominent exception to all ordinary
history; and unless we suppose ourselves running
into an age of miracles, we may not expect its
repetition.</p>

<p>Washington, therefore, could regard, and did regard,
nothing as of paramount political interest but the integrity
of the Union itself. With a united government,
well administered, he saw that we had nothing to
fear; and without it, nothing to hope. The sentiment
is just, and its momentous truth should solemnly
impress the whole country. If we might regard our
country as personated in the spirit of Washington, if we
might consider him as representing her, in her past renown,
her present prosperity, and her future career, and
as in that character demanding of us all to account for
our conduct, as political men or as private citizens, how
should he answer him who has ventured to talk of dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>union
and dismemberment? Or how should he answer
him who dwells perpetually on local interests, and fans
every kindling flame of local prejudice? How should he
answer him who would array State against State, interest
against interest, and party against party, careless of the
continuance of that unity of government which constitutes
us one people?</p>

<p>The political prosperity which this country has attained,
and which it now enjoys, has been acquired
mainly through the instrumentality of the present government.
While this agent continues, the capacity of
attaining to still higher degrees of prosperity exists
also. We have, while this lasts, a political life capable
of beneficial exertion, with power to resist or overcome
misfortunes, to sustain us against the ordinary accidents
of human affairs, and to promote, by active efforts, every
public interest. But dismemberment strikes at the
very being which preserves these faculties. It would
lay its rude and ruthless hand on this great agent itself.
It would sweep away, not only what we possess, but
all power of regaining lost, or acquiring new possessions.
It would leave the country not only bereft of its prosperity
and happiness, but without limbs, or organs, or
faculties, by which to exert itself hereafter in the pursuit
of that prosperity and happiness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dismemberment
of the
United
States the
greatest of
evils.</div>

<p>Other misfortunes may be borne, or their effects overcome.
If disastrous war should sweep our commerce
from the ocean, another generation may renew
it; if it exhaust our treasury, future industry
may replenish it; if it desolate and lay
waste our fields, still, under a new cultivation,
they will grow green again, and ripen
to future harvests. It were but a trifle even if the walls
of yonder Capitol were to crumble, if its lofty pillars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
should fall, and its gorgeous decorations be all covered
by the dust of the valley. All these might be rebuilt.
But who shall reconstruct the fabric of demolished government?
Who shall rear again the well-proportioned
columns of constitutional liberty? Who shall frame
together the skilful architecture which unites national
sovereignty with State rights, individual security, and
public prosperity? No, if these columns fall, they will
be raised not again. Like the Coliseum and the Parthenon,
they will be destined to a mournful, a melancholy
immortality. Bitterer tears, however, will flow
over them than were ever shed over the monuments of
Roman or Grecian art; for they will be the remnants
of a more glorious edifice than Greece or Rome ever
saw, the edifice of constitutional American liberty.</p>

<p>But let us hope for better things. Let us trust in
that gracious Being who has hitherto held our country
as in the hollow of his hand. Let us trust to the virtue
and the intelligence of the people, and to the efficacy
of religious obligation. Let us trust to the influence of
Washington&rsquo;s example. Let us hope that that fear of
Heaven which expels all other fear, and that regard
to duty which transcends all other regard, may influence
public men and private citizens, and lead our country
still onward in her happy career. Full of these gratifying
anticipations and hopes, let us look forward to the
end of that century which is now commenced. A hundred
years hence, other disciples of Washington will
celebrate his birth, with no less of sincere admiration
than we now commemorate it. When they shall meet,
as we now meet, to do themselves and him that honor,
so surely as they shall see the blue summits of his native
mountains rise in the horizon, so surely as they shall
behold the river on whose banks he lived, and on whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
banks he rests, still flowing on toward the sea, so surely
may they see, as we now see, the flag of the Union
floating on the top of the Capitol; and then, as now,
may the sun in his course visit no land more free, more
happy, more lovely, than this our own country!</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">For the
preservation
of the Union.</div>

<p>Mr. President,&mdash;I wish to speak to-day, not as a
Massachusetts man, nor as a Northern man, but as an
American, and a member of the Senate of the United
States. It is fortunate that there is a Senate of the
United States; a body not yet moved from its propriety,
not lost to a just sense of its own dignity and its own
high responsibilities, and a body to which the country
looks, with confidence, for wise, moderate, patriotic, and
healing counsels. It is not to be denied that we live in
the midst of strong agitations, and are surrounded by
very considerable dangers to our institutions and government.
The imprisoned winds are let loose. The
East, the North, and the stormy South combine to throw
the whole sea into commotion, to toss its billows to the
skies, and disclose its profoundest depths. I do not
affect to regard myself, Mr. President, as holding, or as
fit to hold, the helm in this combat with the political
elements; but I have a duty to perform, and I mean to
perform it with fidelity, not without a sense of existing
dangers, but not without hope. I have a part to act,
not for my own security or safety, for I am looking out
for no fragment upon which to float away from the
wreck, if wreck there must be, but for the good of the
whole, and the preservation of all; and there is that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>which will keep me to my duty during this struggle,
whether the sun and the stars shall appear, or shall not
appear, for many days. I speak to-day for
the preservation of the Union. &ldquo;Hear me
for my cause.&rdquo; I speak to-day, out of a
solicitous and anxious heart, for the restoration to the
country of that quiet and that harmony which make
the blessings of this
Union so rich, and
so dear to us all.
These are the topics
that I propose to myself
to discuss; these
are the motives, and
the sole motives, that
influence me in the
wish to communicate
my opinions to the
Senate and the country;
and if I can do
anything, however
little, for the promotion
of these ends, I
shall have accomplished
all that I expect.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peaceable
secession
impossible.</div>

<p>Mr. President, I should much prefer to have heard
from every member on this floor declarations of opinion
that this Union could never be dissolved,
than the declaration of opinion by anybody
that, in any case, under the pressure of any
circumstances, such a dissolution was possible. I hear
with distress and anguish the word &ldquo;secession,&rdquo; espe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>cially
when it falls from the lips of those who are patriotic,
and known to the country, and known all over the
world, for their political services. Secession! Peaceable
secession! Sir, your eyes and mine are never destined
to see that miracle. The dismemberment of this
vast country without convulsion! The breaking up of
the fountains of the great deep without ruffling the surface!
Who is so foolish&mdash;I beg everybody&rsquo;s pardon&mdash;as
to expect to see any such thing? Sir, he who sees
these States now revolving in harmony around a common
centre, and expects to see them quit their places
and fly off without convulsion, may look the next hour
to see the heavenly bodies rush from their spheres, and
jostle against each other in the realms of space, without
causing the wreck of the universe. There can be no
such thing as a peaceable secession. Peaceable secession
is an utter impossibility. Is the great Constitution
under which we live, covering this whole country,&mdash;is
it to be thawed and melted away by secession, as the
snows on the mountain melt under the influence of a
vernal sun, disappear almost unobserved, and run off?
No, Sir! No, Sir! I will not state what might produce
the disruption of the Union; but, Sir, I see as plainly as
I see the sun in heaven what that disruption itself must
produce; I see that it must produce war, and such a
war as I will not describe, in its twofold character.</p>

<p>Peaceable secession! Peaceable secession! The concurrent
agreement of all the members of this great republic
to separate? A voluntary separation, with
alimony on one side and on the other! Why, what
would be the result? Where is the line to be drawn?
What States are to secede? What is to remain American?
What am I to be? An American no longer?
Am I to become a sectional man, a local man, a separat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>ist,
with no country in common with the gentlemen who
sit around me here, or who fill the other house of Congress?
Heaven forbid! Where is the flag of the republic
to remain? Where is the eagle still to tower?
or is he to cower, and shrink, and fall to the ground?
Why, Sir, our ancestors, our fathers and our grandfathers,
those of them that are yet living amongst us
with prolonged lives, would rebuke and reproach us;
and our children and our grandchildren would cry out
shame upon us, if we of this generation should dishonor
these ensigns of the power of the government and the
harmony of that Union which is every day felt among
us with so much joy and gratitude. What is to become
of the army? What is to become of the navy? What
is to become of the public lands? How is each of the
thirty States to defend itself?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The idea of a Southern Confederacy.</div>

<p>I know, although the idea has not been stated distinctly,
there is to be, or it is supposed possible that
there will be, a Southern Confederacy. I do
not mean, when I allude to this statement,
that any one seriously contemplates such a
state of things. I do not mean to say that it is true,
but I have heard it suggested elsewhere that the idea
has been entertained, that, after the dissolution of this
Union, a Southern Confederacy might be formed. I
am sorry, Sir, that it has ever been thought of, talked
of, or dreamed of, in the wildest flights of human imagination.
But the idea, so far as it exists, must be of a
separation assigning the slave States to one side and
the free States to the other. Sir, I may express myself
too strongly, perhaps, but there are impossibilities in
the natural as well as in the physical world, and I hold
the idea of a separation of these States, those that are
free to form one government, and those that are
slave-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>holding to form another, as such an impossibility. We
could not separate the States by any such line, if we
were to draw it. We could not sit down here to-day
and draw a line of separation that would satisfy any five
men in the country. There are natural causes that
would keep and tie us together, and there are social and
domestic relations which we could not break if we
would, and which we should not if we could.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Liberty and
Union.</div>

<p>Instead of speaking of the possibility or utility of
secession, instead of dwelling in those caverns of darkness,
instead of groping with those ideas so
full of all that is horrid and horrible, let us
come out into the light of day; let us enjoy the fresh
air of Liberty and Union; let us cherish those hopes
which belong to us; let us devote ourselves to those
great objects that are fit for our consideration and our
action; let us raise our conceptions to the magnitude
and the importance of the duties that devolve upon us;
let our comprehension be as broad as the country for
which we act, our aspirations as high as its certain destiny;
let us not be pygmies in a case that calls for men.
Never did there devolve on any generation of men
higher trusts than now devolve upon us, for the preservation
of this Constitution and the harmony and
peace of all who are destined to live under it. Let us
make our generation one of the strongest and brightest
links in that golden chain which is destined, I fondly
believe, to grapple the people of all the States to this
Constitution for ages to come. We have a great popular,
constitutional government, guarded by law and by
judicature, and defended by the affections of the whole
people. No monarchical throne presses these States together,
no iron chain of military power encircles them;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
they live and stand under a government popular in its
form, representative in its character, founded upon principles
of equality, and so constructed, we hope, as to
last forever. In all its history it has been beneficent;
it has trodden down no man&rsquo;s liberty; it has crushed no
State. Its daily respiration is liberty and patriotism;
its yet youthful veins are full of enterprise, courage,
and honorable love of glory and renown. Large before,
the country has now, by recent events, become vastly
larger. This republic now extends, with a vast breadth,
across the whole continent. The two great seas of the
world wash the one and the other shore. We realize, on
a mighty scale, the beautiful description of the ornamental
border of the buckler of Achilles:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">AN ADDRESS DELIVERED AT THE LAYING OF THE CORNER
STONE OF THE ADDITION TO THE CAPITOL OF
THE UNITED STATES, AT WASHINGTON, JULY 4, 1851</p>


<p>Fellow-Citizens,&mdash;I greet you well; I give you joy
on the return of this anniversary; and I felicitate you,
also, on the more particular purpose of which this ever-memorable
day has been chosen to witness the fulfilment.
Hail! all hail! I see before and around me a
mass of faces glowing with cheerfulness and patriotic
pride. I see thousands of eyes turned towards other
eyes, all sparkling with gratification and delight. This
is the New World! This is America! This is Washington!
and this the Capitol of the United States!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
And where else, among the nations, can the seat of government
be surrounded, on any day of any year, by those
who have more reason to rejoice in the blessings which
they possess? Nowhere, fellow-citizens! assuredly, nowhere!
Let us, then, meet this rising sun with joy and
thanksgiving!</p>

<p>This is that day of the year which announced to mankind
the great fact of American Independence. This
fresh and brilliant morning blesses our vision with another
beholding of the birthday of our nation; and we
see that nation, of recent origin, now among the most
considerable and powerful, and spreading over the continent
from sea to sea.</p>

<p>Among the first colonists from Europe to this part of
America there were some, doubtless, who contemplated
the distant consequences of their undertaking, and who
saw a great futurity. But, in general, their hopes were
limited to the enjoyment of a safe asylum from tyranny,
religious and civil, and to respectable subsistence by industry
and toil. A thick veil hid our times from their
view. But the progress of America, however slow, could
not but at length awaken genius, and attract the attention
of mankind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bishop
Berkeley&rsquo;s
prophecy.</div>

<p>In the early part of the second century of our history,
Bishop Berkeley, who, it will be remembered, had resided
for some time in Newport, in Rhode
Island, wrote his well-known &ldquo;Verses on the
Prospect of Planting Arts and Learning in
America.&rdquo; The last stanza of this little poem seems to
have been produced by a high poetical inspiration:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Westward the course of empire takes its way;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The four first acts already past,</span><br />
A fifth shall close the drama with the day:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Time&rsquo;s noblest offspring is the last.&rdquo;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>This extraordinary prophecy may be considered only
as the result of long foresight and uncommon sagacity;
of a foresight and sagacity stimulated, nevertheless, by
excited feeling and high enthusiasm. So clear a vision
of what America would become was not founded on
square miles, or on existing numbers, or on any common
laws of statistics. It was an intuitive glance into futurity;
it was a grand conception, strong, ardent, glowing,
embracing all time since the creation of the world,
and all regions of which that world is composed, and
judging of the future by just analogy with the past.
And the inimitable imagery and beauty with which
the thought is expressed, joined to the conception itself,
render it one of the most striking passages in our
language.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Independence
Day.</div>

<p>On the day of the Declaration of Independence our
illustrious fathers performed the first scene
in the last great act of this drama; one in real
importance infinitely exceeding that for which the great
English poet invokes</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">&ldquo;&mdash;a muse of fire,...</span><br />
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,<br />
And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a><br />
</p>

<p>The Muse inspiring our fathers was the Genius of
Liberty, all on fire with a sense of oppression, and a
resolution to throw it off; the whole world was the
stage, and higher characters than princes trod it; and,
instead of monarchs, countries and nations and the age
beheld the swelling scene. How well the characters
were cast, and how well each acted his part, and what
emotions the whole performance excited, let history,
now and hereafter, tell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 4th of July, 1776, the Representatives of
the United States of America, in Congress assembled,
declared that these United Colonies are, and of right
ought to be, <span class="smcap">free and independent States</span>.</p>

<p>This Declaration, made by most patriotic and resolute
men, trusting in the justice of their cause and the protection
of Heaven, and yet made not without deep
solicitude and anxiety, has now stood for seventy-five
years, and still stands. It was sealed in blood. It has
met dangers, and overcome them; it has had enemies,
and conquered them; it has had detractors, and abashed
them all; it has had doubting friends, but it has cleared
all doubts away; and now, to-day, raising its august
form higher than the clouds, twenty millions of people
contemplate it with hallowed love, and the world beholds
it, and the consequences which have followed from it,
with profound admiration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Liberty the
inheritance
of every
American.</div>

<p>This anniversary animates and gladdens and unites
all American hearts. On other days of the year we may
be party men, indulging in controversies
more or less important to the public good;
we may have likes and dislikes, and we may
maintain our political differences, often with
warm, and sometimes with angry, feelings. But to-day
we are Americans all; and all nothing but Americans.
As the great luminary over our heads, dissipating mists
and fogs, now cheers the whole hemisphere, so do the
associations connected with this day disperse all cloudy
and sullen weather in the minds and hearts of true
Americans. Every man&rsquo;s heart swells within him;
every man&rsquo;s port and bearing become somewhat more
proud and lofty, as he remembers that seventy-five years
have rolled away, and that the great inheritance of
liberty is still his: his, undiminished and unimpaired;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
his in all its original glory; his to enjoy, his to protect,
and his to transmit to future generations.</p>

<p>Fellow-citizens, this inheritance which we enjoy
to-day is not only an inheritance of liberty, but of our
own peculiar American liberty. Liberty has existed in
other times, in other countries, and in other forms.
There has been a Grecian liberty, bold and powerful,
full of spirit, eloquence, and fire; a liberty which produced
multitudes of great men, and has transmitted one
immortal name, the name of Demosthenes, to posterity.
But still it was a liberty of disconnected States, sometimes
united, indeed, by temporary leagues and confederacies,
but often involved in wars between themselves.
The sword of Sparta turned its sharpest edge against
Athens, enslaved her, and devastated Greece; and, in
her turn, Sparta was compelled to bend before the power
of Thebes. And let it ever be remembered, especially
let the truth sink deep into all American minds, that
it was the <i>want of union</i> among her several States which
finally gave the mastery of all Greece to Philip of
Macedon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Corner-stone
of the
original
Capitol laid
by Washington.</div>

<p>Fellow-citizens, fifty-eight years ago Washington
stood on this spot to execute a duty like that which has
now been performed.  He then laid the
corner-stone of the original Capitol.  He
was at the head of the government, at that
time weak in resources, burdened with debt,
just struggling into political existence and
respectability, and agitated by the heaving waves which
were overturning European thrones. But even then, in
many important respects, the government was strong.
It was strong in Washington&rsquo;s own great character; it
was strong in the wisdom and patriotism of other eminent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
public men, his political associates and fellow-laborers;
and it was strong in the affections of the people.</p>

<p>Since that time astonishing changes have been
wrought in the condition and prospects of the American
people; and a degree of progress witnessed with which
the world can furnish no parallel. As we review the
course of that progress, wonder and amazement arrest
our attention at every step. The present occasion,
although allowing of no lengthened remarks, may yet,
perhaps, admit of a short comparative statement of
important subjects of national interest as they existed
at that day, and as they now exist. I have adopted for
this purpose the tabular form of statement, as being the
most brief and significant.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The City of Washington.</div>

<p>Who does not feel that, when President Washington
laid his hand on the foundation of the first Capitol, he
performed a great work of perpetuation of
the Union and the Constitution? Who does
not feel that this seat of the general government,
healthful in its situation, central in its position,
near the mountains whence gush springs of wonderful
virtue, teeming with Nature&rsquo;s richest products, and yet
not far from the bays and the great estuaries of the sea,
easily accessible and generally agreeable in climate and
association, does give strength to the union of these
States? that this city, bearing an immortal name, with
its broad streets and avenues, its public squares and magnificent
edifices of the general government, erected for
the purpose of carrying on within them the important
business of the several departments, for the reception
of wonderful and curious inventions, for the preservation
of the records of American learning and genius, of
extensive collections of the products of nature and art,
brought hither for study and comparison from all parts
of the world; adorned with numerous churches, and
sprinkled over, I am happy to say, with many public
schools, where all the children of the city, without distinction,
have the means of obtaining a good education,
and with academies and colleges, professional schools
and public libraries,&mdash;should continue to receive, as it
has heretofore received, the fostering care of Congress,
and should be regarded as the permanent seat of the
national government?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With each succeeding year new interest is added to
the spot; it becomes connected with all the historical
associations of our country, with her statesmen and her
orators; and, alas! its cemetery is annually enriched by
the ashes of her chosen sons.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>Before us is the broad and beautiful river, separating
two of the original thirteen States, which a late President,
a man of determined purpose and inflexible
will, but patriotic heart, desired to
span with arches of ever-enduring granite, symbolical
of the firmly cemented union of the North and the
South. That President was General Jackson.</p>

<p>On its banks repose the ashes of the Father of his
Country; and at our side, by a singular felicity of position,
overlooking the city which he designed,
and which bears his name, rises
to his memory the marble column, sublime
in its simple grandeur, and fitly

any similar structure on the surface of

countrymen be freely contributed to
carry this monument higher and still
higher. May I say, as on another occasion,
&ldquo;Let it rise; let it rise till it meet

<p>Fellow-citizens, what contemplations are awakened in
our minds as we assemble here to re-enact a scene like
that performed by Washington! Methinks I see his
venerable form now before me, as presented in the
glorious statue by Houdon, now in the Capitol of Virginia.
He is dignified and grave; but concern and
anxiety seem to soften the lineaments of his countenance.
The government over which he presides is yet in
the crisis of experiment. Not free from troubles at
home, he sees the world in commotion and in arms all
around him. He sees that imposing foreign powers are
half disposed to try the strength of the recently established
American government. We perceive that mighty
thoughts, mingled with fears as well as with hopes, are
struggling within him. He heads a short procession
over these then naked fields; he crosses yonder stream
on a fallen tree; he ascends to the top of this eminence,
whose original oaks of the forest stand as thick around
him as if the spot had been devoted to Druidical worship,
and here he performs the appointed duty of the
day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">George
Washington&rsquo;s
monition.</div>

<p>And now, fellow-citizens, if this vision were a reality;
if Washington actually were now amongst us, and if he
could draw around him the shades of the
great public men of his own day, patriots
and warriors, orators and statesmen, and
were to address us in their presence, would
he not say to us: &ldquo;Ye men of this generation, I rejoice
and thank God for being able to see that our labors and
toils and sacrifices were not in vain. You are prosperous,
you are happy, you are grateful: the fire of liberty
burns brightly and steadily in your hearts, while <i>duty</i>
and the <i>law</i> restrain it from bursting forth in wild and
destructive conflagration. Cherish liberty, as you love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
it; cherish its securities, as you wish to preserve it.
Maintain the Constitution which we labored so painfully
to establish, and which has been to you such a source of
inestimable blessings. Preserve the union of the States,
cemented as it was by our prayers, our tears and our
blood. Be true to God, to your country, and to your
duty. So shall the whole Eastern world follow the
morning sun to contemplate you as a nation; so shall
all generations honor you, as they honor us; and so
shall that Almighty Power which so graciously protected
us, and which now protects you, shower its everlasting
blessings upon you and your posterity.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The sacred
trust of
Americans.</div>

<p>Great Father of your Country! we heed your words;
we feel their force as if you now uttered them with lips
of flesh and blood. Your example teaches us,
your affectionate addresses teach us, your public
life teaches us your sense of the value of
the blessings of the Union. Those blessings our fathers
have tasted, and we have tasted, and still taste. Nor do
we intend that those who come after us shall be denied
the same high fruition. Our honor as well as our happiness
is concerned. We cannot, we dare not, we will not,
betray our sacred trust. We will not filch from posterity
the treasure placed in our hands to be transmitted to
other generations. The bow that gilds the clouds in the
heavens, the pillars that uphold the firmament, may
disappear and fall away in the hour appointed by the
will of God; but until that day comes, or so long as our
lives may last, no ruthless hand shall undermine that
bright arch of Union and Liberty which spans the continent
from Washington to California. Fellow-citizens,
we must sometimes be tolerant to folly, and patient at
the sight of the extreme waywardness of men; but I
confess that, when I reflect on the renown of our past<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
history, on our present prosperity and greatness, and on
what the future hath yet to unfold, and when I see that
there are men who can find in all this nothing good,
nothing valuable, nothing truly glorious, I feel that all
their reason has fled away from them, and left the entire
control over their judgment and their actions to insanity
and fanaticism; and more
than all, fellow-citizens, if
the purposes of fanatics
and disunionists should
be accomplished, the patriotic
and intelligent of
our generation would seek
to hide themselves from
the scorn of the world,
and go about to find dishonorable
graves.</p>


<div class="sidenote">The preservation
of
the Union
foretold.</div>

<p>Fellow-citizens, take
courage; be of good cheer.
We shall come to no such
ignoble end. We shall
live, and not die. During
the period allotted to our
several lives we shall
continue to rejoice in the return of this anniversary.
The ill-omened sounds of fanaticism will be hushed;
the ghastly spectres of Secession and Disunion
will disappear; and the enemies of united
constitutional liberty, if their hatred cannot be
appeased, may prepare to have their eyeballs
seared as they behold the steady flight of the American
eagle, on his burnished wings, for years and years to come.</p>

<p>President Fillmore, it is your singularly good fortune
to perform an act such as that which the earliest of your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
predecessors performed fifty-eight years ago. You stand
where he stood; you lay your hand on the corner-stone
of a building designed greatly to extend that whose
corner-stone he laid. Changed, changed is everything
around. The same sun, indeed, shone upon his head
which now shines upon yours. The same broad river
rolled at his feet, and bathes his last resting-place, that
now rolls at yours. But the site of this city was then
mainly an open field. Streets and avenues have since
been laid out and completed, squares and public grounds
enclosed and ornamented, until the city which bears his
name, although comparatively inconsiderable in numbers
and wealth, has became quite fit to be the seat of government
of a great and united people.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And now, fellow-citizens, with hearts void of hatred,
envy, and malice towards our own countrymen, or any
of them, or towards the subjects or citizens of other governments,
or towards any member of the great family of
man; but exulting, nevertheless, in our own peace, security,
and happiness, in the grateful remembrance of
the past, and the glorious hopes of the future, let us
return to our homes, and with all humility and devotion
offer our thanks to the Father of all our mercies, political,
social, and religious.</p>

America in 1777, to aid the Revolutionists. At once brave and judicious,
he became the friend of Washington, and was made major-general,
distinguishing himself as a fighter or strategist at Brandywine,
Monmouth, and Yorktown. Returning to France after the war, he
took a middle course in the French Revolution, for which he later was
subjected to the unwarranted sneers of Carlyle. Imprisoned for years
in Austria, he was released by request of Napoleon in 1797. In 1824
he again visited the United States, being everywhere greeted with
enthusiasm, and receiving from Congress $200,000 and a township of

rose under Alexander Ypsilanti in 1820, promulgated a new
constitution in 1822, and began a war of revolution. After bloody atrocities
on both sides, in 1824 the Greeks began to receive some outside help,
including that of Lord Byron, who died at Missolonghi, in that year,
from exposure in the field. The jealousies and intrigues of Mahmoud,
Sultan of Turkey, and Mehemet Ali, Turkish Viceroy of Egypt, with
fears of Russian preponderance in a divided Turkey, led the Great
Powers of Europe to interfere in behalf of Greece, as the Turks and
Egyptians were working together against her. The Treaty of London
(July 6, 1827) founded the new Kingdom of Greece; England, France,
and Russia overwhelmed the fleets of Turkey and Egypt at Navarino,
October 26 of the same year; and the independent career of the
resuscitated Greek nation began.</p></div>

the remains of the breastwork. Warren fell about two hundred feet

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> The question has often been asked whether the anonymous speech
against the Declaration of Independence, and the speech in support of
it ascribed to John Adams in the preceding address, are a portion of
the debates which actually took place in 1776 in the Continental Congress.
Those speeches were composed by Mr. Webster, after the
manner of the ancient historians, as embodying the arguments relied
upon by the friends and opponents of the measure, respectively. They
represent speeches actually made on both sides, but no report of the
debates of this period has been preserved, and Mr. Webster had no aid
in framing these addresses but what was furnished by tradition and
the known line of argument pursued by the speakers and writers of
that day for and against the measure of Independence. The first sentence
of the speech ascribed to Mr. Adams was suggested by the parting
scene with Jonathan Sewall, as described by Mr. Adams himself,
in the Preface to the &ldquo;Letters of Novanglus and Massachusettensis.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The following answer was written by Mr. Webster to one of the
letters of inquiry above alluded to.
</p><p style='text-align: right'>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, 22 <i>January</i>, 1846.
</p><p class="noidt">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir:&mdash;</span>
</p><p>
&ldquo;I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the
18th instant. Its contents hardly surprise me, as I have received very
many similar communications.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Your inquiry is easily answered. The Congress of the Revolution
sat with closed doors. Its proceedings were made known to the public
from time to time, by printing its journal; but the debates were not
published. So far as I know, there is not existing, in print or manuscript,
the speech, or any part or fragment of the speech, delivered by
Mr. Adams on the question of the Declaration of Independence. We
only know, from the testimony of his auditors, that he spoke with
remarkable ability and characteristic earnestness.
</p><p>
&ldquo;The day after the Declaration was made, Mr. Adams, in writing to
a friend, declared the event to be one that &lsquo;ought to be commemorated,
as the day of deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion to God
Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with
shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from
one end of this continent to the other, from this time forward, forevermore.&rsquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;And on the day of his death, hearing the noise of bells and cannon,
he asked the occasion. On being reminded that it was &lsquo;Independent
day,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;Independence forever!&rsquo; These expressions were
introduced into the speech <i>supposed</i> to have been made by him. For
the rest I must be answerable. The speech was written by me, in
my house in Boston, the day before the delivery of the Discourse in
Faneuil Hall; a poor substitute, I am sure it would appear to be, if
we could now see the speech actually made by Mr. Adams on that
transcendently important occasion.
</p><p style='text-align: right'>

bed, in Salem, Massachusetts, on the morning of April 7, 1830. A few
weeks later four men&mdash;Richard Crowninshield, George Crowninshield,
John Francis Knapp, and Joseph J. Knapp, Jr.&mdash;were arrested on the
charge of murder. On June 15 Richard Crowninshield committed
suicide in his cell; George Crowninshield, having proved an alibi, was
discharged; and the two Knapps were tried between July 20 and
August 20, the former as principal and the latter as accessory. Joseph
made a full confession, outside of court, on the government&rsquo;s promise
of impunity; but afterwards refused to repeat this testimony on the
witness-stand. It was shown that the fatal blow was struck by Richard
Crowninshield; that John Francis Knapp, who had bargained with
Richard Crowninshield to commit the murder, was lurking in the neighborhood
during the commission of the crime; and that Joseph J.
Knapp was also an accessory before the fact, having, indeed, projected
the murder. The Knapps were executed. A detailed description of
the extraordinary network of circumstances, before and after the
murder, is given in the volume entitled &ldquo;Great Speeches and Orations
of Daniel Webster.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> The &ldquo;Great Debate&rdquo; in the Senate, between Webster and Hayne,
had an unexpected origin. A resolution had been introduced by
Senator Samuel Augustus Foot, of Connecticut, merely ordering an
inquiry into the expediency of throwing restrictions around future
sales of public lands of the United States. Into the discussion of this
resolution, which lasted five months, was brought a large number of
partisan pleas, tariff arguments, local jealousies, and questions of the
right and wrong of slavery, and of the respective powers of the State
and national governments. Recriminations and even personalities
were not infrequent; and some of the Southern speakers did not
refrain, in defence of the new &ldquo;nullification&rdquo; doctrine, from criticism
of New England Federalism as having been essentially selfish, derisive,
and unpatriotic. Senator Robert Young Hayne (1791-1840), of
South Carolina, who had been a member of the Senate since 1823, was
conspicuous, in this debate, for his advocacy of the idea that a
State might suspend Federal laws at its discretion; and his assertions
to that effect, combined with sharp criticisms of Massachusetts, led
Mr. Webster to make his famous reply. Mr. Hayne was subsequently
Governor of South Carolina, at the time of the almost armed collision
between that State and President Jackson, in 1832, over the nullification
of tariff laws. At one time Governor Hayne actually issued a
proclamation of resistance to the authority of the general government;
but subsequently Congress modified the objectionable tariff provisions
and the State repealed its nullification ordinance, which President
Jackson&rsquo;s firmness had certainly made &ldquo;null, void, and no law.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_27_27" id="Footnote_27_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> It had been charged that John Quincy Adams, during his presidency
(1825-1829), had sought to purchase the support of Webster by
giving offices to members of the old Federalist party, then merging
into the &ldquo;National Republican&rdquo; or Whig party. Furthermore, the
opposition had declared that Adams&rsquo;s bestowal of the Secretaryship
of State upon Henry Clay was in accordance with a bargain
by which Adams was to be supported by the Clay vote in the House
of Representatives.</p></div>

Confederation,&mdash;prior to the beginning of the constitutional government
of the United States in 1789,&mdash;which, in its sixth article, said of
the &ldquo;Northwest Territory,&rdquo; organized by this Ordinance: &ldquo;There shall
be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory,
otherwise than in the punishment of crimes whereof the party shall
have been duly convicted.&rdquo; Under the provisions of this Ordinance
Ohio became a State in 1802. Says Johnston in his &ldquo;History of American
Politics &ldquo;: &ldquo;The Ordinance of 1787 is noteworthy as an exercise by
the Congress of the Confederacy of the right to exclude slavery from
the territories. It will be found that the language of this Ordinance
was copied in the efforts made in 1819 (Missouri), 1846 (Wilmot Proviso),
and 1865 (XIIIth Amendment), to assert and maintain for the
Federal Congress under the Constitution this power of regulating and
abolishing slavery in the territories of the United States, and finally
in the States as the result of civil war.&rdquo;</p></div>

were protests of the Republican, or Anti-Federalist, legislatures of the
two States, against the &ldquo;Alien and Sedition Laws&rdquo; passed by the Federalist
majority in Congress. These laws were the outgrowth of an
almost warlike feeling between the United States and France, due to a
variety of causes, for the most part discreditable to France. They
authorized the President to order out of the country any foreigner he
deemed dangerous; and imposed fines and imprisonment upon alleged
conspirators against Government measures, or libellers of Congress or
the President. The laws were deemed by the Anti-Federalists to be
autocratic and semi-monarchical. The Virginia protesting resolutions
were put into form by James Madison, afterwards President.</p></div>

These men liberated prisoners and &ldquo;arrested&rdquo; the assessors themselves;
and Fries, when marching toward Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,
resisted a United States marshal. He was tried for treason in 1799,
found guilty, given a new trial in 1800, again found guilty, and sentenced
to be hanged; but President John Adams, against the advice of
all his cabinet, pardoned him and gave a general amnesty to the rioters.
Fries became a well-to-do merchant in Philadelphia.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_39_39" id="Footnote_39_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> Interesting examples of Webster&rsquo;s revision of important passages
in this speech may be found by comparing the present standard text
with the original versions as preserved in the Boston Public Library.
The eulogium of Massachusetts, beginning &ldquo;Mr. President, I shall
enter on no encomium&rdquo; and ending with &ldquo;the very spot of its origin,&rdquo;
was spoken thus:
</p><p>
&ldquo;Sir, I shall be led on this occasion into no eulogium on Massachusetts.
I shall paint no portraiture of her merits, original, ancient or
modern. Yet, Sir, I cannot but remember that Boston was the cradle
of liberty, that in Massachusetts (the parent of this accursed policy so
eternally narrow to the West), etc., etc., etc. I cannot forget that Lexington,
Concord and Bunker Hill <i>are</i> in Massachusetts, and that in
men and means and money she <i>did</i> contribute more than any other
State to carry on the Revolutionary war. There was not a State in
the Union whose soil was not wetted with Massachusetts blood in the
Revolutionary war, and it is to be remembered that of the army to
which Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown a majority consisted of
New England troops. It is painful to me to recur to these recollections
even for the purpose of self-defence, and even to that end, Sir, I will
not extol the intelligence, the character and the virtue of the people
of New England. I leave the theme to itself, here and everywhere,
now and forever.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The first form of the famous concluding passage was as follows:
</p><p>
&ldquo;When my eyes shall be turned for the last time on the meridian
sun, I hope I may see him shining bright upon my united, free, and
happy country. I hope I shall not live to see his beams falling upon
the dispersed fragments of the structure of this once glorious Union.
I hope I may not see the flag of my country with its stars separated or
obliterated; torn by commotions, smoking with the blood of civil war.
I hope I may not see the standard raised of separate State rights, star
against star, and stripe against stripe; but that the flag of the Union
may keep its stars and its stripes corded and bound together in indissoluble
ties. I hope I shall not see written as its motto, &lsquo;<i>First</i> liberty,
and <i>then</i> Union.&rsquo; I hope I shall see no such delusive and deluded
motto on the flag of that country. I hope to see, spread all over it,
blazoned in letters of light and proudly floating over land and sea, that
other sentiment, dear to my heart, &lsquo;Union <i>and</i> Liberty, now and forever,
one and inseparable.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></div>

resumed in the last-named year, under a Congressional appropriation,
and steadily pushed forward until the completion of the noble obelisk
in 1884, at a total cost of $1,300,000. It is built of white Maryland
marble, and is 555 feet high&mdash;the loftiest masonry construction in the
